<statement>
Which is traveling faster, a car whose velocity vector is
\(30\vec i + 35\vec j\), or a car whose velocity vector is
\(40\vec i\), assuming that the units are the same for
both directions?
\leavevmode\\\relax

 is the faster car.

At what speed is the faster car traveling?

speed = \mbox{\parbox[t]{12.5ex}{\hrulefill}}



</statement>
<solution>
\par \par {\bf Solution: }\par  SOLUTION \par 

We need to calculate the length of each vector to find the speeds of
the two cars:
\[|| 30\vec i + 35\vec j || = \sqrt{30^2 + 35^2} = \sqrt{2125}
    \approx 46.098\]
and
\[|| 40\vec i || = \sqrt{40^2} = 40.\]
So the first car is faster.
