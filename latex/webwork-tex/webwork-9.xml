<statement>
You are looking down at a map.  A vector \(\bf{u}\) with 
 \(\left| \mathbf{u} \right|\)  = 10 points north and a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) 
with  \(\left| \mathbf{v} \right|\)  = 9 points northeast.  The crossproduct 
\(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\) points:

\par 
A) south\leavevmode\\\relax 
B) northwest\leavevmode\\\relax 
C) up\leavevmode\\\relax 
D) down\leavevmode\\\relax 
\par 
Please enter the letter of the correct answer: \mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}
\par 


The magnitude  \(\left| \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \right|\) =
\mbox{\parbox[t]{12.5ex}{\hrulefill}}
