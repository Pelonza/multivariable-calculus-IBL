<statement>
Suppose \(\vec{F}(x,y) = -y \vec{i} + x \vec{j}\) 
and \(C\) is the line segment from point 
\(P = \left(5,0\right)\) to \(Q = \left(0,2\right)\). 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
(a) Find a vector parametric equation \(\vec{r}(t)\) for the line 
segment \(C\) so that points \(P\) and \(Q\) correspond
to \(t = 0\) and \(t = 1\), respectively.  
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\(\vec{r}(t) =\) \mbox{\parbox[t]{20ex}{\hrulefill}}
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
(b) Using the parametrization in part (a), the line
integral of \(\vec{F}\) along \(C\) is
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\(\displaystyle \int_C \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{r} = \int_a^b \vec{F}(\vec{r}(t)) \cdot \vec{r}\,'(t) \, dt = \int_a^b\)
\mbox{\parbox[t]{20ex}{\hrulefill}}
\(dt\)
\leavevmode\\\relax 
with limits of integration 
\(a =\) \mbox{\parbox[t]{5ex}{\hrulefill}} and
\(b =\) \mbox{\parbox[t]{5ex}{\hrulefill}}
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
(c) Evaluate the line integral in part (b).
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\mbox{\parbox[t]{10ex}{\hrulefill}}
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
(d) What is the line integral of \(\vec{F}\) 
around the clockwise-oriented triangle 
with corners at the origin, \(P\), and \(Q\)?  
Hint: Sketch the vector field and the triangle.
