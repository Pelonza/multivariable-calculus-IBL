<statement>
Suppose \(\vec{F}(x,y) = (x + 5) \vec{i} + (6 y + 2) \vec{j}\).  
Use the fundamental theorem of line integrals
to calculate the following.

\leavevmode\\\relax 
(a) The line integral of \(\vec{F}\) along the
line segment \(C\) from the point \(P = (1,0)\) 
to the point \(Q = (3,1)\).
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\(\displaystyle \int_C \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r}\) =
\mbox{\parbox[t]{15ex}{\hrulefill}}
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
(b) The line integral of \(\vec{F}\) along the 
triangle \(C\) from the origin to the point 
\(P = (1,0)\) to the point 
\(Q = (3,1)\) and back to the origin.
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\(\displaystyle \int_C \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r}\) =
