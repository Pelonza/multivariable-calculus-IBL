<statement>
Find a vector parametrization of the curve \(x = -2 z^2\) 
in the xz-plane.  Use \(t\) as the 
parameter in your answer.

\par \par {\bf Solution: }\par  SOLUTION: \leavevmode\\\relax  \leavevmode\\\relax 
Since the curve is in the \(xz\)- plane, it must be \(y = 0\). 
Letting \(z = t\) yields \(x = -2t^{2}\).
\leavevmode\\\relax 
Thus a vector parametrization of the curve is 
\[\vec{r}(t) = \langle -2t^{2}, 0, t \rangle\]
