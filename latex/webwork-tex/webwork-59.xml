<statement>
An unevenly heated metal plate has temperature \(T(x,y)\)
in degrees Celsius at a point \((x,y)\).  If 
\(T(2,1) = 146\), \(T_x \, (2,1) = 9\),
and \(T_y \, (2,1) = -13\), estimate the temperature
at the point \((2.05,0.95)\).

\(T(2.05,0.95) \approx\) \mbox{\parbox[t]{20ex}{\hrulefill}}.  
Please include {\bf \underline{units}} in your answer.
