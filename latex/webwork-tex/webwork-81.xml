<statement>
Suppose \(\vec{F}(x,y) = \langle 2y, -\sin(y) \rangle\) 
and \(C\) is the circle of radius \(9\) centered at
the origin oriented counterclockwise. 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
(a) Find a vector parametric equation \(\vec{r}(t)\) for the 
circle \(C\) that starts at the point \((9,0)\) and 
travels around the circle once counterclockwise for 
\(0 \leq t \leq 2\pi\).  
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\(\vec{r}(t) =\) \mbox{\parbox[t]{20ex}{\hrulefill}}
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
(b) Using your parametrization in part (a), set up an 
integral for calculating the circulation of \(\vec{F}\) 
around \(C\).
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\(\displaystyle \int_C \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{r} = \int_a^b \vec{F}(\vec{r}(t)) \cdot \vec{r}\,'(t) \, dt = \int_a^b\)
\mbox{\parbox[t]{20ex}{\hrulefill}}
\(dt\)
\leavevmode\\\relax 
with limits of integration 
\(a =\) \mbox{\parbox[t]{5ex}{\hrulefill}} and
\(b =\) \mbox{\parbox[t]{5ex}{\hrulefill}}
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
(c) Find the circulation of \(\vec{F}\) around \(C\).
\leavevmode\\\relax 
Circulation = \mbox{\parbox[t]{10ex}{\hrulefill}}
