<statement>
Find the line integral with respect to arc length 
\(\displaystyle \int_C (3 x + 4 y) ds\), where \(C\) is
the line segment in the \(xy\)-plane with endpoints \(P = \left(8,0\right)\) 
and \(Q = \left(0,9\right)\).
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
(a) Find a vector parametric equation \(\vec{r}(t)\) for the line 
segment \(C\) so that points \(P\) and \(Q\) correspond
to \(t = 0\) and \(t = 1\), respectively.  
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\(\vec{r}(t) =\) \mbox{\parbox[t]{15ex}{\hrulefill}}
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
(b) Using the parametrization in part (a), the line
integral with respect to arc length is
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\(\displaystyle \int_C (3 x + 4 y) ds = \int_a^b\)
\mbox{\parbox[t]{20ex}{\hrulefill}}
\(dt\)
\leavevmode\\\relax 
with limits of integration 
\(a =\) \mbox{\parbox[t]{5ex}{\hrulefill}} and
\(b =\) \mbox{\parbox[t]{5ex}{\hrulefill}}
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\leavevmode\\\relax 
(c) Evaluate the line integral with respect to arc length in part (b).
\leavevmode\\\relax 
\(\displaystyle \int_C (3 x + 4 y) ds =\) 
\mbox{\parbox[t]{20ex}{\hrulefill}}
