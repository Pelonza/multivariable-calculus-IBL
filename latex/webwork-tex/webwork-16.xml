<statement>
A constant force \({\mathbf F} = 8 {\mathbf i} + 7 {\mathbf j} + 8 {\mathbf k}\) moves an object
along a straight line from point \((-6, -2, 4)\) to point \((-3, 13, -8)\).  
\par  Find the work done if the distance is measured in meters and the magnitude of the force
is measured in newtons.
