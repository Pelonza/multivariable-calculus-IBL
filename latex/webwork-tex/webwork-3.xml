Find the equation of a sphere if one of its diameters has endpoints:
(7, 6, 7) and (11, 10, 11).

\par 

\mbox{\parbox[t]{20ex}{\hrulefill}} = 0

\leavevmode\\\relax  Note that you must move everything to the left hand side of the equation 
and that we desire the coefficients of the quadratic terms to be 1.
