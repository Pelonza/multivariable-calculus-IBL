From Dr. Woodruff:%
\par
This course may be like no other course in mathematics you have ever taken. We'll discuss in class some of the key differences, and eventually this section will contain a complete description of how this course works. For now, it's just a skeleton.%
\par
I received the following email about 6 months after a student took the course:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-1}{}
Hey Brother Woodruff,%
\par
I was reading \emph{Knowledge of Spiritual Things} by Elder Scott. I thought the following quote would be awesome to share with your students, especially those in Math 215 :)%
\par
Profound [spiritual] truth cannot simply be poured from one mind and heart to another. It takes faith and diligent effort. Precious truth comes a small piece at a time through faith, with great exertion, and at times wrenching struggles.%
\end{quote}
Elder Scott's words perfectly describe how we acquire mathematical truth, as well as spiritual truth.%

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Teaching philosophy}
From Dr. Schmitt:%
\par
Over time, I've come to view teaching and learning as a shared journey on which my students and I embark each semester. I am the subject matter expert responsible for providing information and guidance, setting expectations, and assessing how well students meet those expectations. My students are responsible for much hard work, including preparing in advance for class, participating in class activities, and doing out-of-class assignments, regardless of whether or not they are graded. There is only so much that can be conveyed in \(50\) minutes, and my own personal experience and educational research agree that students get far less out of a \(50\)-minute lecture than their professors hope. Thus, I have chosen to take an approach that is more work both for you and for me but has been shown to produce better results. During class you will work on a carefully chosen series of problems designed to build the mathematical knowledge and experience you need to succeed. These problems will be done in a collaborative, small group setting where you can grapple with and truly understand the material. I'll be there to support, guide, and correct misconceptions. Sure, I could expect you to do this alone outside of class, but over time I've realized a few things about working in groups. As a student, I usually understood something better when I went over it with classmates, even if I was the one who thought I understood it completely and explained it to a peer. As a researcher, I am more productive and effective when I collaborate. Friends in industry report that teams are increasingly used to produce the best results. Furthermore, having me there to help in the early stages ensures that we're traveling together on this journey.%

We'll need to know how to graph by hand some basic functions. If you have not spent much time graphing functions by hand before this class, then you should spend some time graphing the following functions by hand. When we start drawing functions in 3D, we'll have to piece together infinitely many 2D graphs. Knowing the basic shape of graphs will help us do this.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{firstreview}
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-1} Provide a rough sketch of the following functions, showing their basic shapes:%
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle x^2, x^3, x^4, \frac{1}{x}, \sin x, \cos x, \tan x, \sec x, \arctan x, e^x,\ln x.
\end{equation*}
%
\item\label{task-2} Use a computer algebra system, such as \href{http://http://www.wolframalpha.com/}{Wolfram Alpha}, to verify your work. I suggest Wolfram Alpha, because it is now built into Mathematica 8.0+. If you can learn to use Wolfram Alpha, you will be able to use Mathematica.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-1}
You are also welcome to use Maple or Sage. On the surface both Mathematica and Maple are very similar, while Sage is meant to be more multi-purpose.%

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Derivatives}]{Derivatives}\label{subsection-2}
In first semester calculus, one of the things you focused on was learning to compute derivatives. You'll need to know the derivatives of basic functions (found on the end cover of almost every calculus textbook). Computing derivatives accurately and rapidly will make learning calculus in high dimensions easier. The following rules are crucial. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Power rule {\((x^n)' = nx^{n-1}\)}%
\item{}Sum and difference rule {\((f\pm g) = f'\pm g'\)}%
\item{}Product {\((fg)' = f' g + fg'\)} and quotient rule  {\(\ds\left(\frac f g\right)' = \frac{f' g - fg'}{g^2}\)}%
\item{}Chain rule (arguably the most important) {\((f\circ g)' = f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)\)}%
\end{itemize}
%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-2}
Compute the derivative of \(e^{\sec x}\cos(\tan(x)+\ln(x^2+4))\).%
\par
Show each step in your computation, making sure to show what rules you used.%
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-3}
If \(y(p) = \ds \frac{e^{p^3}\cot(4p+7)}{\tan^{-1}(p^4)}\) find \(dy/dp\).%
\par
Again, show each step in your computation, making sure to show what rules you used.%
\end{exploration}
The following problem will help you review some of your trigonometry, inverse functions, as well as implicit differentiation.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-4}
Use implicit differentiation to explain why the derivative of \(y=\arcsin x\) is \(\ds y'=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad Rewrite \(y=\arcsin x\) as \(x=\sin y\), differentiate both sides, solve for \(y'\), and then write the answer in terms of \(x\).%

\typeout{Subsection 1.1.3 Integrals}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Integrals}]{Integrals}\label{subsection-3}
Each derivative rule from the front cover of your calculus text is also an integration rule. In addition to these basic rules, we'll need to know three integration techniques. They are \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-9}{}{\(u\)}-substitution,%
\item\hypertarget{li-10}{}integration-by-parts, and%
\item\hypertarget{li-11}{}integration by using software.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
There are many other integration techniques, but we will not focus on them. If you are trying to compute an integral to get a number while on the job, then software will almost always be the tool you use. As we develop new ideas in this and future classes (in engineering, physics, statistics, math), you'll find that \(u\)-substitution and integrations-by-parts show up so frequently that knowing when and how to apply them becomes crucial.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-5}
Compute \(\ds\int x\sqrt{x^2+4}dx\).%

\typeout{Section 1.2 Differentials}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[{Differentials}]{Differentials}\label{ch01_2_differentials}
The derivative of a function gives us the slope of a tangent line to that function. We can use this tangent line to estimate how much the output (\(y\) values) will change if we change the input (\(x\)-value). If we rewrite the notation \(\ds\frac{dy}{dx}=f'\) in the form \(dy=f' dx\), then we can read this as ``A small change in \(y\) (called \(dy\)) equals the derivative (\(f'\)) times a small change in \(x\) (called \(dx\)).''%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-1}
We call \(dx\) the differential of \(x\). If \(f\) is a function of \(x\), then the differential of \(f\) is \(df = f'(x) dx\). Since we often write \(y=f(x)\), we'll interchangeably use \(dy\) and \(df\) to represent the differential of \(f\).%
\end{definition}
We will often refer to the differential notation \(dy=f'dx\) as ``a change in the output \(y\) equals the derivative times a change in the input \(x\).''%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-9}
If \(f(x) = x^2\ln(3x+2)\) and \(g(t) = e^{2t}\tan(t^2)\) then compute \(df\) and \(dg\).%
\end{exploration}
Most of higher dimensional calculus can quickly be developed from differential notation. Once we have the language of vectors and matrices at our command, we will develop calculus in higher dimensions by writing \(d\vec y = Df(\vec x) d\vec x\). Variables will become vectors, and the derivative will become a matrix.%
\par
This problem will help you see how the notion of differentials is used to develop equations of tangent lines. We'll use this same idea to develop tangent planes to surfaces in 3D and more.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{differentialtangentline}
 Consider the function \(y=f(x) = x^2\). This problem has multiple steps, but each is fairly short.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-2}
The linearization of a function is just an equation of the tangent line where you solve for \(y\).%
\end{aside}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-3} Find the differential of \(y\) with respect to \(x\).%
\item\label{task-4} Draw a graph of \(f(x)\). Place a dot at the point \((3,9)\) and label it on your graph. Sketch a tangent line to the graph at the point \((3,9)\) on the same axes. Place another dot on the tangent line up and to the right of (3,9). Label the point \((x,y)\), as it will represent any point on the tangent line.%
\item\label{task-5} Using the two points \((3,9)\) and \((x,y)\), compute the slope of the line connecting these two points. Your answer should involve \(x\) and \(y\).%
\par
What is the rise (i.e, the change in \(y\) called \(dy\))? What is the run (i.e, the change in \(x\) called \(dx\))?%
\item\label{task-6} We know the slope of the tangent line is the derivative \(f'(3)=6\). We also know the slope from the previous part. These two must be equal. Use this fact to give an equation of the tangent line to \(f(x)\) at \(x=3\). (Hint: do NOT simplify to slope-intercept form)%
\item\label{task-7} How is the equation for the tangent line related to the differentials \(dy\) and \(dx\)?%
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exploration}[]\label{diff-sphere}
The manufacturer of a spherical storage tank needs to create a tank with a radius of 3 m. Recall that the volume of a sphere is \(V(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\). No manufacturing process is perfect, so the resulting sphere will have a radius of 3 m, plus or minus some small amount \(dr\). The actual radius will be \(3+dr\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-8} Find the differential \(dV\). This should be a formula with \(dV\), \(r\), and \(dr\).%

\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-12}
A forest ranger needs to estimate the height of a tree. The ranger stands 50 feet from the base of tree and measures the angle of elevation to the top of the tree to be about 60\(^\circ\). If this angle of 60\(^\circ\) is correct, then what is the height of the tree? If the ranger's angle measurement could be off by as much as \(5^\circ\), then how much could his estimate of the height be off? Use differentials to give an answer.%

Find all solutions to the linear system \(\begin{cases}x+y+z\amp =3\\2x-y\amp =4

One common way to deal with solving such a system is to let one variable equal \(t\), and then solve for the other variables in terms of \(t\). Do this three different ways.%

\typeout{************************************************}
\section[{Optional: Higher Order Approximations}]{Optional: Higher Order Approximations}\label{taylorseries}
When you ask a calculator to tell you what \(e^{.1}\) means, your calculator uses an extension of differentials to give you an approximation. The calculator only uses polynomials (multiplication and addition) to give you an answer. This same process is used to evaluate any function that is not a polynomial (so trig functions, square roots, inverse trig functions, logarithms, etc.) The key idea needed to approximate functions is illustrated by the next problem.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-15}
Let \(f(x)=e^x\). You should find that your work on each step can be reused to do the next step.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-18} Find a first degree polynomial \(P_1(x)=a+bx\) so that \(P_1(0)=f(0)\) and \(P'_1(0)=f'(0)\). In other words, give me a line that passes through the same point and has the same slope as \(f(x)=e^x\) does at \(x=0\). Set up a system of equations and then find the unknowns \(a\) and \(b\). The next two are very similar.%
\item\label{task-19} Find a second degree polynomial \(P_2(x)=a+bx+cx^2\) so that \(P_2(0)=f(0)\), \(P'_2(0)=f'(0)\), and \(P''_2(0)=f''(0)\). In other words, give me a parabola that passes through the same point, has the same slope, and has the same concavity as \(f(x)=e^x\) does at \(x=0\).%
\item\label{task-20} Find a third degree polynomial \(P_3(x)=a+bx+cx^2+dx^3\) so that \(P_3(0)=f(0)\), \(P'_3(0)=f'(0)\), \(P''_3(0)=f''(0)\), and \(P'''_3(0)=f'''(0)\). In other words, give me a cubic that passes through the same point, has the same slope, the same concavity, and the same third derivative as \(f(x)=e^x\) does at \(x=0\).%
\item\label{task-21} Now compute \(e^{.1}\) with a calculator.  Then compute \(P_1(.1)\), \(P_2(.1)\), and \(P_3(.1)\). How accurate are the line, parabola, and cubic in approximating \(e^{.1}\)?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-16}
Now let \(f(x)=\sin x\). Find a 7th degree polynomial so that the function and the polynomial have the same value and same first seven derivatives when evaluated at \(x=0\). Evaluate the polynomial at \(x=0.3\). How close is this value to your calculator's estimate of \(\sin(0.3)\)? You may find it valuable to use the notation%
\begin{equation*}
P(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3 +\cdots+a_7 x^7.
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-5}
The polynomial you are creating is often called a Taylor polynomial. (I'm giving you the name so that you can search online for more information if you are interested.)%
\end{aside}
\end{exploration}
The previous two problems involved finding polynomial approximations to the function at \(x=0\). The next problem shows how to move this to any other point, such as \(x=1\).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{Taylor_at_1}
Let \(f(x)=e^x\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-22} Find a second degree polynomial%
\begin{equation*}
T(x)=a+bx+cx^2
\end{equation*}
so that \(T(1)=f(1)\), \(T'(1)=f'(1)\), and \(T''(1)=f''(1)\). In other words, give me a parabola that passes through the same point, has the same slope, and the same concavity as \(f(x)=e^x\) does at \(x=1\).%
\item\label{task-23} \begin{aside}{}\label{aside-6}
Notice that we just replaced \(x\) with \(x-1\). This centers, or shifts, the approximation to be at \(x=1\). The first part will be much simpler now when you let \(x=1\).%
\end{aside}
Find a second degree polynomial written in the form%
\begin{equation*}
S(x)=a+b(x-1)+c(x-1)^2
\end{equation*}
so that \(S(1)=f(1)\), \(S'(1)=f'(1)\), and \(S''(1)=f''(1)\). In other words, find a quadratric that passes through the same point, has the same slope, and the same concavity as \(f(x)=e^x\) does at \(x=1\).%
\item\label{task-24} Find a third degree polynomial written in the form%
\begin{equation*}
P(x)=a+b(x-1)+c(x-1)^2+d(x-1)^3
\end{equation*}
so that \(P(1)=f(1)\), \(P'(1)=f'(1)\), \(P''(1)=f''(1)\), and \(P'''(1)=f'''(1)\). In other words, give me a cubic that passes through the same point, has the same slope, the same concavity, and the same third derivative as \(f(x)=e^x\) does at \(x=1\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-1}
This example refers back to \hyperref[diff-sphere]{Exercise~\ref{diff-sphere}}. We wanted a spherical tank of radius 3m, but due to manufacturing error the radius was slightly off. Let's now illustrate how we can use polynomials to give a first, second, and third order approximation of the volume if the radius is 3.02m instead of 3m.%
\par
We start with \(V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\) and then compute the derivatives%
\begin{equation*}
V'=4\pi r^2, V''=8\pi r, \text{ and }  V'''=8\pi.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Because we are approximating the increase in volume from \(r=3\) to something new, we'll create our polynomial approximations centered at \(r=3\). We'll consider the polynomial%
\begin{equation*}
P(r)=a_0+a_1(r-3)+a_2(r-3)^2+a_3(r-3)^3,
\end{equation*}
whose derivatives are%
\begin{equation*}
P'=a_1+2a_2(r-3)+3a_3(r-3)^2,
P''=2a_2+6a_3(r-3),
P'''=6a_3.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
So that the derivatives of the volume function match the derivatives of the polynomial (at \(r=3\)), we need to satisfy the equations in the table below.%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
&&&\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(k\)&Value of \(V\) at the \(k\)th derivative&Value of \(P\) at the the \(k\)th derivative&Equation\tabularnewline[0pt]

\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{table-1}}
\end{table}
This tells us that the third order polynomial is%
\begin{equation*}
P(r)=a_0+a_1(r-3)+a_2(r-3)^2+a_3(r-3)^3
=36\pi+36\pi(r-3)+12\pi(r-3)^2+\frac{4}{3}\pi(r-3)^3
.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
We wanted to approximate the volume if \(r=3.2\), so our change in \(r\) is \(dr=3.2-3=0.2\). We can rewrite our polynomial as%
\begin{equation*}
P(r)=36\pi+36\pi(dr)+12\pi(dr)^2+\frac{4}{3}\pi(dr)^3.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
We are now prepared to approximate the volume using a first, second, and third order approximation. \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-12}{}A first order approximation yields \(P=36\pi+ 36\pi\cdot 0.02 =36.72\pi.\) The volume increased by \(0.72\pi\) m\(^3\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-13}{}A second order approximation yields%
\begin{equation*}
P=36\pi+ 36\pi\cdot 0.02 +12\pi (0.02)^2 =36.7248\pi.
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-14}{}A third order approximation yields%
\begin{equation*}
P=36\pi+36\pi\cdot 0.02 +12\pi (0.02)^2+\frac{4}{3}\pi(0.02)^3  =36.724810\bar6\pi.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
With each approximation, we add on a little more volume to get closer to the actual volume of a sphere with radius \(r=3.02\). The actual volume of a sphere involves a cubic function, so when we approximate the volume with a cubic, we should get an exact approximation (and \(V(3.02) = \frac 43 \pi (3.02)^3 =(36.724810\bar6)\pi\).)%
\end{example}
We'll end this section with a problem to practice the example above.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-18}
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-7}
As a challenge, try to draw a 3D graph which illustrates the volume added on by each successive approximation. If you have it before we get here as a class, let me know and I'll let you share what you have discovered with the class.%
\end{aside}
Suppose you are constructing a cube whose side length should be \(s=2\) units. The manufacturing process is not exact, but instead creates a cube with side lengths \(s=2+ds\) units. (You should assume that all sides are still the same, so any error on one side is replicated on all. We have to assume this for now, but before the semester ends we'll be able to do this with high dimensional calculus.)%

Suppose that the machine creates a cube with side length \(2.3\) units instead of 2 units. Note that the volume of the cube is \(V=s^3\). Use a first, second, and third order approximation to estimate the increase in volume caused by the .3 increase in side length. Then compute the actual increase in volume \(V(2.3)-V(2)\).%

Learning to work with vectors will be key tool we need for our work in high dimensions. Let's start with some problems related to finding distance in 3D, drawing in 3D, and then we'll be ready to work with vectors.%

\subsection[{Finding Distances}]{Finding Distances}\label{subsection-4}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-19}
To find the distance between two points \((x_1,y_1)\) and \((x_2,y_2)\) in the plane, we create a triangle connecting the two points. The base of the triangle has length \(\Delta x=(x_2-x_1)\) and the vertical side has length \(\Delta y=(y_2-y_1)\). The Pythagorean theorem gives us the distance between the two points as \(\sqrt{\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2}=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-25} Draw a 3-D axis then plot the points \((1,5)\) and \((2,3)\)%
\item\label{task-26} Sketch the triangle that connects these two points and the origin \textemdash{} \((0,0)\)%
\item\label{task-27} Find \(\Delta x\) and \(\Delta y\)%
\item\label{task-28} Now extend your picture into 3 and use it to show that the distance between two points \((x_1,y_1,z_1)\) and \((x_2,y_2,z_2)\) in 3-dimensions is \(\sqrt{\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2+\Delta z^2}=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}\).%
\item\label{task-29} Use this formula to find the distance between the points \((1,5,2)\) and \((2,3,3)\)%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-20}
Recall that a circle (or sphere in 3-D) is just a collection of points which are all equal distance away from a center point.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-30} If the center of a circle is the point \((1,5)\) what is the equation for a circle which passes through the point \((2,3)\)?%
\item\label{task-31} Find the distance between the two points \(P=(2,3,-4)\) and \(Q=(0,-1,1)\).%
\item\label{task-32} Now find an equation of the sphere passing though point \(Q\) whose center is at \(P\). Hint: Each point on the surface of a sphere is \(r\) distance away from the center.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-2}
A vector is a magnitude in a certain direction. If \(P\) and \(Q\) are points, then the vector \(\vec{PQ}\) is the directed line segment from \(P\) to \(Q\). This definition holds in 1D, 2D, 3D, and beyond. If \(V=(v_1,v_2,v_3)\) is a point in space, then to talk about the vector \(\vec v\) from the origin \(O\) to \(V\) we'll use any of the following notations:%
\begin{equation*}
\vec v = \vec{OV}=\left\lt v_1,v_2,v_3\right> 
= v_1\mathbf{i}+v_2\mathbf{j}+v_3\mathbf{k} 
= (v_1,v_2,v_3) 
= \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\ v_2\\ v_3
\end{pmatrix} 
.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The entries of the vector are called the \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) (or i, j, k) components of the vector.%
\end{definition}
Note that \((v_1,v_2,v_3)\) could refer to either the point \(V\) or the vector \(\vec v\). The context of the problem we are working on will help us know if we are dealing with a point or a vector.%

Let \(\mathbb{R}\) represent the set real numbers. Real numbers are actually 1D vectors.%
\par
Let \(\mathbb{R}^2\) represent the set of vectors \((x_1,x_2)\) in the plane.%
\par
Let \(\mathbb{R}^3\) represent the set of vectors \((x_1,x_2,x_3)\) in space. There's no reason to stop at 3, so let \(\mathbb{R}^n\) represent the set of vectors \((x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\) in \(n\) dimensions.%
\end{definition}
In first semester calculus and before, most of our work dealt with problem in \(\mathbb{R}\) and \(\mathbb{R}^2\). Most of our work now will involve problems in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and \(\mathbb{R}^3\). We've got to learn to visualize in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{def_vecadd}
Suppose \(\vec x=\left\lt x_1,x_2,x_3\right>\) and \(\vec y=\left\lt y_1,y_2,y_3\right>\) are two vectors in 3D, and \(c\) is a real number. We define vector addition and scalar multiplication as follows: \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Vector addition: \(\vec x+\vec y = (x_1+y_1,x_2+y_2,x_3+y_3)\) (add component-wise).%

\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{prob_donkey}
Consider the vector \(\vec v=\langle 3,-1 \rangle\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-33} Draw \(\vec v\), \(-\vec v\), and \(3\vec v\).%
\item\label{task-34} Suppose a donkey travels along the path given by \((x,y)=\vec v t = (3t,-t)\), where \(t\) represents time.%
\par
At the following times, where is the donkey?%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\roman*),ref=\theenumi.\roman*]
\item\label{task-35} \(t=0\) ?%
\item\label{task-36} \(t=1\) ?%
\item\label{task-37} \(t=2\) ?%
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{task-38} Draw an axis, then sketch the path followed by the donkey.%
\item\label{task-39} Where is the donkey at time \(t=0,1,2\)? Put markers with labels on your graph to show the donkey's location.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
In a previous problem \hyperref[prob_donkey]{Exercise~4} you encountered \((x,y)=(3t,-t)\). This is an example of a function where the input is \(t\) and the output is a vector \((x,y)\). For each input \(t\), you get a single vector output \((x,y)\). Such a function is called a parametrization of the donkey's path. Because the output is a vector, we call the function a vector-valued function. Often, we'll use the variable \(\vec r\) to represent the radial vector \((x,y)\), or \((x,y,z)\) in 3D. So we could rewrite the position of the donkey as \(\vec r(t)=(3,-1)t\). We use \(\vec r\) instead of \(r\) to remind us that the output is a vector.%
\par
Let's look at another, similar problem.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{prob_horseline}
Suppose a horse races down a path given by the vector-valued function \(\vec r(t) = (1,2)t+(3,4)\). (Remember this is the same as writing \((x,y) =  (1,2)t+(3,4)\) or similarly \((x,y)=(1t+3,2t+4)\).)%

\item\label{task-40} Where is the horse at time \(t=0,1,2\)?%
\item\label{task-41} Draw an set of axis and put markers on your graph to show the horse's location.%
\item\label{task-42} Draw the path followed by the horse.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
In the last two problems we described the donkey and horse's paths using vectors. The use of vectors actually lets us do a lot more like give a generalized direction or easily compute their speed at any point along the path. To do that we need to define two more mathematical ideas, the magnitude and unit-vector.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 2.1.3 Magnitude and The Unit-Vector}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Magnitude and The Unit-Vector}]{Magnitude and The Unit-Vector}\label{subsection-6}
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-5}
The magnitude, or length, or norm of a vector \(\vec v = \left\lt v_1,v_2,v_3\right>\) is \(|\vec v| = \sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2}\). It is just the distance from the point \((v_1,v_2,v_3)\) to the origin.%
\par
Note that in 1D, the length of the vector \(\left\lt -2\right>\) is simply \(|-2|=\sqrt{(-2)^2}=2\), the distance to 0. Our use of the absolute value symbols is appropriate, as it generalizes the concept of absolute value (distance to zero) to all dimensions.%
\end{definition}
In the special circumstance where a vector represents an object's velocity, the magnitude of the vector gives the objects \emph{speed} or non-directional velocity.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-6}
A unit vector is a vector whose length is one unit. The notation for a unit vector is generally a ``\(\hat{\ }\)'' or \terminology{bold face}. Equivalently, the unit vector of a vector \(\vec{v}\) is: \(\hat{v}=\frac{\vec{v}}{|\vec{v}|}\)%
\par
The standard unit vectors are \(\mathbf{i}=\left\lt 1,0,0\right>\), \(\mathbf{j}=\left\lt 0,1,0\right>\), \(\mathbf{k}=\left\lt 0,0,1\right>\).%

Show that if two nonzero vectors \(\vec u\) and \(\vec v\) are orthogonal, then the angle between them is 90\(^\circ\). Then show that if the angle between them is 90\(^\circ\), then the vectors are orthogonal. I.E. expand and compute both sides of the formula \(\vec u\cdot \vec v=|\vec u||\vec v|\cos\theta\) with non-zero, orthogonal vectors.%

The dot product provides a really easy way to find when two vectors meet at a right angle. The dot product is precisely zero when this happens.%

Associated with every square matrix is a number, called the determinant. Determinants are only defined for square matrices. Determinants measure area, volume, length, and higher dimensional versions of these ideas. Determinants will appear as we study cross products and when we get to the high dimensional version of {\(u\)}-substitution.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-9}
The determinant of a {\(2\times 2\)} matrix is the number%
\begin{align*}
\det\begin{bmatrix}a\amp b\\
c\amp d\end{bmatrix} \amp =\begin{vmatrix}a\amp b\\
c\amp d\end{vmatrix} = ad-bc.
\end{align*}
%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-8}
We use vertical bars next to a matrix to state we want the determinant, so \(\det A = |A|\).%
\end{aside}
The determinant of a {\(3\times 3\)} matrix is the number %
\begin{align*}
\begin{vmatrix}a\amp b\amp c\\
d\amp e\amp f\\
g\amp h\amp i\end{vmatrix} \amp = a\det\begin{vmatrix}e\amp f\\

g\amp i\end{vmatrix} +c\det\begin{vmatrix}d\amp e\\

\amp =a(ei-hf)-b(di-gf)+c(dh-ge).

For extra practice, create your own square matrix (2 by 2 or 3 by 3) and compute the determinant by hand. Then use \href{http://www.wolframalpha.com}{Wolfram Alpha} to check your work.  Do this until you feel comfortable taking determinants.%

\end{exploration}
What good is the determinant? The determinant was discovered as a result of trying to find the area of a parallelogram and the volume of the three dimensional version of a parallelogram (called a parallelepiped) in space. If we had a full semester to spend on linear algebra, we could eventually prove the following facts that I will just present here with a few examples.%
\par
Consider the 2 by 2 matrix \(\begin{bmatrix}3\amp 1\\0\amp 2
\end{bmatrix}\) whose determinant is \(3\cdot 2-0\cdot 1=6\). Draw the column vectors \(\begin{bmatrix}3\\0
\end{bmatrix}\) and \(\begin{bmatrix}1\\2
\end{bmatrix}\) with their base at the origin (see \hyperref[detfig]{figure~2}). These two vectors give the edges of a parallelogram whose area is the determinant \(6\). If I swap the order of the two vectors in the matrix, then the determinant of \(\begin{bmatrix}1\amp 3\\2\amp 0
\end{bmatrix}\) is \(-6\). The reason for the difference is that the determinant not only keeps track of area, but also order. Starting at the first vector, if you can turn counterclockwise through an angle smaller than 180\(^\circ\) to obtain the second vector, then the determinant is positive. If you have to turn clockwise instead, then the determinant is negative. This is often termed ``the right-hand rule,'' as rotating the fingers of your right hand from the first vector to the second vector will cause your thumb to point up precisely when the determinant is positive.%
\begin{figure}

$\begin{vmatrix}{3}\amp {1}\\{0}\amp {2}\end{vmatrix}=6$ and $\begin{vmatrix}{1}\amp {3}\\{2}\amp 0\end{vmatrix}=-6$
}
\caption{The determinant gives both area and direction. A counter clockwise rotation from column 1 to column 2 gives a positive determinant.\label{detfig}}
\end{figure}
For a 3 by 3 matrix, the columns give the edges of a three dimensional parallelepiped and the determinant produces the volume of this object. The sign of the determinant is related to orientation. If you can use your right hand and place your index finger on the first vector, middle finger on the second vector, and thumb on the third vector, then the determinant is positive. For example, consider the matrix \(A = \begin{bmatrix}{ \begin{matrix}1\\0\\0
\end{matrix}     }\amp  { \begin{matrix}0\\2\\0
\end{matrix}     }\amp  { \begin{matrix}0\\0\\3
\end{matrix}     }
\end{bmatrix}\). Starting from the origin, each column represents an edge of the rectangular box \(0\leq x\leq 1\), \(0\leq y\leq 2\), \(0\leq z\leq 3\) with volume (and determinant) \(V=lwh=(1)(2)(3)=6\). The sign of the determinant is positive because if you place your index finger pointing in the direction (1,0,0) and your middle finger in the direction (0,2,0), then your thumb points upwards in the direction (0,0,3). If you interchange two of the columns, for example \(B = \begin{bmatrix}{ \begin{matrix}0\\2\\0
\end{matrix}     }\amp  { \begin{matrix}1\\0\\0
\end{matrix}     }\amp  { \begin{matrix}0\\0\\3
\end{matrix}     }
\end{bmatrix}\), then the volume doesn't change since the shape is still the same. However, the sign of the determinant is negative because if you point your index finger in the direction (0,2,0) and your middle finger in the direction (1,0,0), then your thumb points down in the direction (0,0,-3). If you repeat this with your left hand instead of right hand, then your thumb points up.%

\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
The dot product gave us a way of multiplying two vectors together, but the result was a number, not a vectors. We now define the cross product, which will allow us to multiply two vectors together to give us another vector. We were able to define the dot product in all dimensions. The cross product is only defined in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).%
\begin{definition}[{The Cross Product}]\label{cross_def}
The cross product of two vectors \(\vec u = \left\lt u_1,u_2,u_3\right>\) and \(\vec v = \left\lt v_1,v_2,v_3\right>\) is a new vector \(\vec u\times \vec v\). This new vector is (1) orthogonal to both \(\vec u\) and \(\vec v\), (2) has a length equal to the area of the parallelogram whose sides are these two vectors, and (3) points in the direction your thumb points as you curl the base of your right hand from \(\vec u\) to \(\vec v\). The formula for the cross product is%
\begin{equation*}
\vec u\times \vec v = \left\lt u_2v_3-u_3v_2,-(u_1v_3-u_3v_1),u_1v_2-u_2v_1\right> = \det\begin{bmatrix}\vec i \amp  \vec j\amp \vec k\\ u_1\amp u_2\amp u_3\\ v_1\amp v_2\amp v_3
\end{bmatrix} .
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-10}
This definition is not really a definition.  It is actually a theorem.  If you use the formula given as the definition, then you would need to prove the three facts. We have the tools to give a complete proof of (1) and (3), but we would need a course in linear algebra to prove (2). It shouldn't be too much of a surprise that the cross product is related to area, since it is defined in terms of determinants%

Suppose a heavy box needs to be lowered down a ramp. The box exerts a downward force of 200 Newtons, which we will write in vector notation as \(\vec F=\left\lt 0,-200\right>\). The ramp was placed so that the box needs to be moved right 6 m, and down 3 m, so we need to get from the origin \((0,0)\) to the point \((6,-3)\). This displacement can be written as \(\vec d=\left\lt 6,-3\right>\). The force \(F\) acts straight down, which means the ramp takes some of the force. Our goal is to find out how much of the 200N the ramp takes, and how much force must be applied to prevent the box from sliding down the ramp (neglecting friction). We are going to break the force \(\vec F\) into two components, one component in the direction of \(\vec d\), and another component orthogonal to \(\vec d\).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{prob_force_intro}
Read the preceding paragraph.%
\par
We want to write \(\vec F\) as the sum of two vectors: \(\vec F = \vec w+\vec n\) \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}where \(\vec w\) is parallel to \(\vec d\)%
\item{}and \(\vec n\) is orthogonal to \(\vec d\)%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
Since \(\vec w\) is parallel to \(\vec d\), we can write \(\vec w=c\vec d\) for some unknown scalar \(c\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-83} Rewrite \(\vec F\) in terms of \(\vec d\)%
\item\label{task-84} Take the dot-product of both sides with \(\vec d\)%
\item\label{task-85} Since \(\vec n\) is orthogonal to \(\vec d\) we know that \(\vec n \cdot \vec d =\) ?%
\item\label{task-86} Substitute and solve for the unknown \(c\)%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
The solution to the previous problem gives us the definition of a projection.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-11}
The projection of \(\vec F\) onto \(\vec d\), written \(\proj_{\vec d}\vec F\), is defined as%
\begin{equation*}
\proj_{\vec d}\vec F = \left(\frac{\vec F\cdot \vec d}{\vec d\cdot \vec d}\right)\vec d.
\end{equation*}

Let \(\vec u=(-1,2)\) and \(\vec v=(3,4)\). Compute the \(\proj_{\vec v}\vec u\). Draw \(\vec u,\) \(\vec v\), and \(\proj_{\vec v}\vec u\) all on one set of axis. Then draw a line segment from the head of \(\vec u\) to the head of the projection.%
\par
Now let \(\vec w=(-2,0)\). Compute \(\proj_{\vec v}\vec w\). Draw \(\vec u,\) \(\vec v\), and \(\proj_{\vec v}\vec w\). Then draw a line segment from the head of \(\vec w\) to the head of the projection.%
\end{exploration}
One application of projections pertains to the concept of work. Work is the transfer of energy. If a force \(F\) acts through a displacement \(d\), then the most basic definition of work is \(W=Fd\), the product of the force and the displacement. This basic definition has a few assumptions. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The force \(F\) must act in the same direction as the displacement.%
\item{}The force \(F\) must be constant throughout the entire displacement.%
\item{}The displacement must be in a straight line.%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
Before the semester ends, we will be able to remove all 3 of these assumptions. The next problem will show you how dot products help us remove the first assumption.%
\par
Recall the set up to \hyperref[prob_force_intro]{Exercise~1}. We want to lower a box down a ramp (which we will assume is frictionless). Gravity exerts a force of \(\vec F=\left\lt 0,-200\right>\) N. If we apply no other forces to this system, then gravity will do work on the box through a displacement of \(\left\lt 6,-3\right>\) m. The work done by gravity will transfer the potential energy of the box into kinetic energy (remember that work is a transfer of energy). How much energy is transferred?%
\begin{exploration}[Projection Application: Work]\label{first_work_problem}
Find the amount of work done by the force \(\vec F=\left\lt 0,-200\right>\) through the displacement \(\vec d=\left\lt 6,-3\right>\). Find this by doing the following:%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-87} Find the projection of \(\vec F\) onto \(\vec d\). This tells you how much force acts in the direction of the displacement. Find the magnitude of this projection.%
\item\label{task-88} Since work equals \(W=Fd\), multiply your answer above by \(|\vec {d}|\).%
\item\label{task-89} Now compute \(\vec F\cdot \vec d\).%
\end{enumerate}
\bigbreak
You have just shown that \(W=\vec F\cdot \vec d\) when \(\vec F\) and \(\vec d\) are not in the same direction.%
\end{exploration}

\typeout{************************************************}
\section[{Conic Sections}]{Conic Sections}\label{section-11}
Before we jump fully into \(\mathbb{R}^3\), we need some good examples of planar curves (curves in \(\mathbb{R}^2\)) that we'll extend to object in 3D. These examples are conic sections. We call them conic sections because you can obtain each one by intersecting a cone and a plane (I'll show you in class how to do this). Here's a definition.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-12}
Consider two identical, infinitely tall, right circular cones placed vertex to vertex so that they share the same axis of symmetry. A conic section is the intersection of this three dimensional surface with any plane that does not pass through the vertex where the two cones meet.%
\end{definition}
These intersections are called circles (when the plane is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry), parabolas (when the plane is parallel to one side of one cone), hyperbolas (when the plane is parallel to the axis of symmetry), and ellipses (when the plane does not meet any of the three previous criteria).%
\par
The definition above provides a geometric description of how to obtain a conic section from cone. We'll not introduce an alternate definition based on distances between points and lines, or between points and points. Let's start with one you are familiar with.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-13}
Consider the point \(P=(a,b)\) and a positive number \(r.\) A circle circle with center \((a,b)\) and radius \(r\) is the set of all points \(Q=(x,y)\) in the plane so that the segment \(PQ\) has length \(r\).%
\end{definition}
Using the distance formula, this means that every circle can be written in the form \((x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2\).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-54}
The equation \(4x^2+4y^2+6x-8y-1=0\) represents a circle (though initially it does not look like it). Use the method of completing the square to rewrite the equation in the form \((x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2\) (hence telling you the center and radius). Then generalize your work to find the center and radius of any circle written in the form \(x^2+y^2+Dx+Ey+F=0\).%
\end{exploration}
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 3.1.1 Parabolas}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Parabolas}]{Parabolas}\label{subsection-15}
Before proceeding to parabolas, we need to define the distance between a point and a line.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-14}
Let \(P\) be a point and \(L\) be a line. Define the distance between \(P\) and \(L\) (written \(d(P,L)\)) to be the length of the shortest line segment that has one end on \(L\) and the other end on \(P\). Note: This segment will always be perpendicular to \(L\).%
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-15}
Given a point \(P\) (called the focus) and a line \(L\) (called the directrix) which does not pass through \(P\), we define a parabola as the set of all points \(Q\) in the plane so that the distance from \(P\) to \(Q\) equals the distance from \(Q\) to \(L\). The vertex is the point on the parabola that is closest to the directrix.%
\end{definition}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-55}
Consider the line \(L:y=-p\), the point \(P=(0,p)\), and another point \(Q=(x,y)\). Use the distance formula to show that an equation of a parabola with directrix \(L\) and focus \(P\) is \(x^2=4py\). Then use your work to explain why an equation of a parabola with directrix \(x=-p\) and focus \((p,0)\) is \(y^2=4px\).%
\end{exploration}
Ask me about the reflective properties of parabolas in class, if I have not told you already. They are used in satellite dishes, long range telescopes, solar ovens, and more. The following problem provides the basis to these reflective properties and is optional. If you wish to present it, let me know. I'll have you type it up prior to presenting in class.%
\begin{exploration}[Optional]\label{exploration-56}
Consider the parabola \(x^2=4py\) with directrix \(y=-p\) and focus \((0,p)\). Let \(Q=(a,b)\) be some point on the parabola. Let \(T\) be the tangent line to \(L\) at point \(Q\). Show that the angle between \(PQ\) and \(T\) is the same as the angle between the line \(x=a\) and \(T\). This shows that a vertical ray coming down towards the parabola will reflect of the wall of a parabola and head straight towards the vertex.%
\end{exploration}
The next two problems will help you use the basic equations of a parabola, together with shifting and reflecting, to study all parabolas whose axis of symmetry is parallel to either the \(x\) or \(y\) axis.%

\subsection[{Ellipses}]{Ellipses}\label{subsection-16}
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-16}
Given two points \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) (called foci) and a fixed distance \(d\), we define an ellipse as the set of all points \(Q\) in the plane so that the sum of the distances \(F_1Q\) and \(F_2Q\) equals the fixed distance \(d\). The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment \(F_1F_2\). The two foci define a line. Each of the two points on the ellipse that intersect this line is called a vertex. The major axis is the segment between the two vertexes. The minor axis is the largest segment perpendicular to the major axis that fits inside the ellipse.%
\end{definition}
We can derive an equation of an ellipse in a manner very similar to how we obtained an equation of a parabola. The following problem will walk you through this.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-11}
We will not have time to present this problem in class. However, if you would like to complete the problem and write up your solution on the wiki, you can obtain presentation points for doing so. Let me know if you are interested.%
\end{aside}
\begin{exploration}[Optional]\label{exploration-61}
Consider the ellipse produced by the fixed distance \(d\) and the foci \(F_1=(c,0)\) and \(F_2=(-c,0)\). Let \((a,0)\) and \((-a,0)\) be the vertexes of the ellipse.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-101} Show that \(d=2a\) by considering the distances from \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) to the point \(Q=(a,0)\).%
\item\label{task-102} Let \(Q=(0,b)\) be a point on the ellipse.  Show that \(b^2+c^2=a^2\) by considering the distance between \(Q\) and each focus.%
\item\label{task-103} Let \(Q=(x,y)\). By considering the distances between \(Q\) and the foci, show that an equation of the ellipse is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1.
\end{equation*}
%
\item\label{task-104} Suppose the foci are along the \(y\)-axis (at \((0,\pm c)\)) and the fixed distance \(d\) is now \(d=2b\), with vertexes \((0,\pm b)\). Let \((a,0)\) be a point on the \(x\) axis that intersect the ellipse.  Show that we still have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1,
\end{equation*}
but now we instead have \(a^2+c^2=b^2\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
You'll want to use the results of the previous problem to complete the problems below. The key equation above is \(\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1\). The foci will be on the \(x\)-axis if \(a>b\), and will be on the \(y\)-axis if \(b>a\). The second part of the problem above shows that the distance from the center of the ellipse to the vertex is equal to the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs go from the center to a focus, and from the center to an end point of the minor axis.%

\section[{Parametric Equations}]{Parametric Equations}\label{section-12}
In middle school, you learned to write an equation of a line as \(y=mx+b\). In the vector unit, we learned to write this in vector form as:%
\begin{equation*}
(x,y)=(1,m)t+(0,b)
\end{equation*}
%
\par
This style of equation is called a vector equation. It is equivalent to writing the two equations%
\begin{equation*}
x=1t+0,y=mt+b,
\end{equation*}
which we call the parametric equations of the line. We were able to quickly develop equations of lines in space, by just adding a third equation for \(z\).%
\par
Parametric equations provide us with a way of specifying the location \((x,y,z)\) of an object by giving an equation for each coordinate. We will use these equations to model motion in the plane and in space. In this section we'll focus mostly on planar curves.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-18}
If each of \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous functions, then the curve in the plane defined by \(x=f(t),y=g(t)\) is called a parametric curve, and the equations \(x=f(t),y=g(t)\) are called parametric equations for the curve.%
\end{definition}
You can generalize this definition to 3D and beyond by just adding more variables.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-72}

\subsection[{Derivatives and Tangent lines}]{Derivatives and Tangent lines}\label{sec_derivatives_and_tangent_lines}
We're now ready to discuss calculus on parametric curves. The derivative of a vector valued function is defined using the same definition as first semester calculus.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-19}
If \(\vec r(t)\) is a vector equation of a curve (or in parametric form just \(x=f(t), y=g(t)\)), then the derivative is defined as:%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d\vec r}{dt}=\ds\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\vec r(t+h)-\vec r(t)}{h}.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{definition}
The subtraction above requires vector subtraction. The following problem will provide a simple way to take derivatives which we will use all semester long.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-77}
Show that if \(\vec r(t) = (f(t),g(t))\), then the derivative is just \(\frac{d\vec r}{dt} = (f'(t),g'(t))\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad [The definition above says that \(\frac{d\vec r}{dt}=\ds\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\vec r(t+h)-\vec r(t)}{h}\). We were told \(\vec r(t) = (f(t),g(t))\), so use this in the derivative definition. Then try to modify the equation to obtain \(\frac{d\vec r}{dt} = (f'(t),g'(t))\).]%
\end{exploration}
The previous problem shows you can take the derivative of a vector valued function by just differentiating each component separately. The next problem shows you that velocity and acceleration are still connected to the first and second derivatives.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-78}
Consider the parametric curve given by \(\vec r(t)=( 3\cos t, 3\sin t )\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-127} Graph the curve \(\vec r\), and compute \(\frac{d\vec r}{dt}\) and \(\frac{d^2\vec r}{dt^2}\).%
\item\label{task-128} On your graph, draw the vectors \(\frac{d\vec r}{dt}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\) and \(\frac{d^2\vec r}{dt^2}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\) with their tail placed on the curve at \(\vec r\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\). These vectors represent the velocity and acceleration vectors.%
\item\label{task-129} Give a vector equation of the tangent line to this curve at \(t=\frac{\pi}{4}\). (You know a point and a direction vector.)%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{def_velocity_acceleration}
If an object moves along a path \(\vec r(t)\), we can find the velocity and acceleration by just computing the first and second derivatives. The velocity is \(\frac{d\vec r}{dt}\), and the acceleration is \(\frac{d^2\vec r}{dt^2}\). Speed is a scalar, not a vector. The speed of an object is just the length (or magnitude) of the velocity vector.%
\end{definition}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-79}

This section covers: \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}finding rates of change along space curves%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
If an object moves at a constant speed, then the distance travelled is%
\begin{equation*}
\text{ distance }  = \text{ speed } \times\text{ time } .
\end{equation*}
%
\par
This requires that the speed be constant. What if the speed is not constant? Over a really small time interval \(dt\), the speed is almost constant, so we can still use the idea above. The following problem will help you develop the key formula for arc length.%
\begin{exploration}[Derivation of the arc length formula]\label{exploration-80}
Suppose an object moves along the path given by:%
\begin{equation*}
\vec r(t)=(x(t),y(t))
\end{equation*}
for%
\begin{equation*}
a\leq t\leq b
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-134} Show that the object's speed at any time \(t\) is \(\ds\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2}\).%
\item\label{task-135} If you move over a really small time interval, say of length \(dt\), then the speed is almost constant. If you move at a constant speed of \(\ds\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2}\) for a time length of \(dt\), what's the distance \(ds\) you have traveled.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad This should be really fast to write down%
\item\label{arc_length_formula} \begin{aside}{}\label{aside-17}
This is the arc length formula. Ask me in class for an alternate way to derive this formula.%
\end{aside}
Explain why the length of the path given by \(\vec r(t)\) for \(a\leq t\leq b\) is%
\begin{equation*}
\text{ Arc Length } =s=\int ds=\int_a^b \left|\frac{d\vec r}{dt}\right| dt=\int_a^b \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2}dt.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-81}
Use the equation from \hyperref[arc_length_formula]{Task~\ref{exploration-80}.\ref{arc_length_formula}} to find the length of the curve \(\ds \vec r(t) = \left(t^3,\frac{3t^2}{2}\right)\) for \(t\in[1,3]\). The notation \(t\in[1,3]\) means \(1\leq t\leq 3\). Be prepared to show us your integration steps in class (you'll need a \(u\)-substitution).%

\section[{Polar Coordinates}]{Polar Coordinates}\label{ch05_01_polar_coordinates}
Up to now, we have most often given the location of a point (or coordiantes of a vector) by stating the \((x,y)\) coordinates. These are called the Cartesian (or rectangular) coordinates. Some problems are much easier to work with if we know how far a point is from the origin, together with the angle between the \(x\)-axis and a ray from the origin to the point.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-83}

\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-140} Find the distance \(r\) from \(P\) to the origin.%
\item\label{task-141} Consider the ray \(\stackrel{\rightarrow}{OP}\) from the origin through \(P\). Find an angle between \(\vec{OP}\) and the \(x\)-axis.%

\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-84}
Suppose that a point \(Q=(a,b)\) is 6 units from the origin, and the angle the ray \(\vec{OQ}\) makes with the \(x\)-axis is \(\pi/4\) radians. Find the Cartesian (rectangular) coordinates \((a,b)\) of \(Q\).%
\end{exploration}
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-21}
Let \(Q\) be be a point in the plane with Cartesian coordinates \((x,y)\). Let \(O=(0,0)\) be the origin. We define the polar coordinates of \(Q\) to be the ordered pair \((r,\theta)\) where \(r\) is the displacement from the origin to \(Q\), and \(\theta\) is an angle of rotation (counter-clockwise) from the \(x\)-axis to the ray \(\vec {OP}\).%
\end{definition}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-85}
The following points are given using their polar coordinates. Plot the points in the Cartesian plane, and give the Cartesian (rectangular) coordinates of each point. The points are%

\ds \left( -3,\frac{\pi}{4}\right),\text{ and } 
\ds \left( -2,-\frac{\pi}{6}\right).

%

The next problem provides general formulas for converting between the Cartesian (rectangular) and polar coordinate systems.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{prob_polar_coordinate_equations}
Suppose that \(Q\) is a point in the plane with Cartesian coordinates \((x,y)\) and polar coordinates \((r,\theta)\).%

\item\label{task-143} Write a formula to find the distance \(r\) from \(Q\) to the origin (in terms of \(x\) and \(y\))%
\item\label{task-144} Write a formula to find the angle \(\theta\) between the \(x\)-axis and a line connecting \(Q\) to the origin.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad A picture of a triangle will help here.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
In \hyperref[prob_polar_coordinate_equations]{Exercise~4}, you should have obtained the equations%
\begin{equation*}
x=r\cos\theta,  y=r\sin\theta.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
We can write this in vector notation as \(\begin{pmatrix}x\\y
\end{pmatrix} =\begin{pmatrix}r\cos\theta\\ r\sin\theta
\end{pmatrix}\). This is a vector equation in which you input polar coordinates \((r,\theta)\) and get out Cartesian coordinates \((x,y)\). So you input one thing to get out one thing, which means that we have a function. We could write \(\vec T(r,\theta) = (r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)\), where we've used the letter \(T\) as the name of the function because it is a transformation between coordinate systems. To emphasize that the domain and range are both two dimensional systems, we could also write \(T:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2\). In the next chapter, we'll spend more time with this notation.%
\par
The following problem will show you how to graph a coordinate transformation. When you're done, you should essentially have polar graph paper.%

To construct a graph of a polar curve, just create an \(r,\theta\) table. Choose values for \(\theta\) that will make it easy to compute any trig functions involved. Then connect the points in a smooth manner, making sure that your radius grows or shrinks appropriately as your angle increases.%

Recall that for parametric curves \(\vec r(t) = (x(t),y(t))\), to find the slope of the curve we compute%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
A polar curve of the form \(r=f(\theta)\) can be thought of as the parametric curve \((x,y) = (f(\theta)\cos\theta,f(\theta)\sin\theta)\). So you can find the slope by computing%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy/d\theta}{dx/d\theta}.
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-95}
Consider the polar curve \(r=1+2\cos \theta\). (It wouldn't hurt to provide a quick sketch of the curve.)%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-157} Compute both \(dx/d\theta\) and \(dy/d\theta\).%
\item\label{task-158} Find the slope \(dy/dx\) of the curve at \(\theta=\pi/2\).%
\item\label{task-159} Give both a vector equation of the tangent line, and a Cartesian equation of the tangent line at \(\theta=\pi/2\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
You can find arc length for parametric curves using the formula:%
\begin{equation*}
s=\int_a^b\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
If we replace \(t\) with \(\theta\), this becomes a formula for arc length in polar coordinates. However, the formula can be simplified.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-96}
Recall that \(x=r\cos\theta\) and \(y=r\sin\theta\). Suppose that \(r=f(\theta)\) for \(\theta\in[\alpha,\beta]\) is a continuous function, and that \(f'\) is continuous. Show that the arc length formula can be simplified to%
\begin{equation*}
s=\int_{\alpha}^{\beta}\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{d\theta}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dy}{d\theta}\right)^2} 
= \int_{\alpha}^{\beta}\sqrt{r^2+\left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2} .
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Hint.}\quad the product rule and Pythagorean identity will help.%

Sometimes a problem can't be solved until the correct coordinate system is chosen. You have previously done problems which showed you how to graph the coordinate transformation given by polar coordinates. The following problem shows you how to graph in a different coordinate system.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{prob_transform1}
Consider the coordinate transformation \(T(a,\omega)=(a\cos\omega,a^2\sin \omega)\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-162} Let \(a=3\) and then graph the curve \(\vec T(3,\omega)=(3\cos\omega,9\sin\omega)\) for \(\omega\in[0,2\pi]\).%
\par
You can use the following SageMath Cell to check your answer.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
T(a,omega)=(a*cos(omega), a^2*sin(omega))
print "T(a=3) is", T(a=3)
parametric_plot(T(a=3), (omega, 0, 2*pi))
\end{lstlisting}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad You can start by making a \(\omega,x,y\) table.%
\item\label{task-163} Let \(\omega=\frac{\pi}{4}\) and then, on the same axes as above, add the graph of \(\vec T\left(a,\frac{\pi}{4}\right)=\left(a\frac{\sqrt 2}{2},a^2 \frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\right)\) for \(a\in[0,4]\).%
\par
Again, you can use the SageMath Cell to check your answer. Notice that you can add the two plots together to superimpose them on each other.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
T(a,omega)=(a*cos(omega), a^2*sin(omega))

The height of the point is \(z\) units up from the \(xy\) plane. The point casts a shadow in the \(xy\) plane at \(Q=(x,y,0)\).

The point casts a shadow in the \(xy\) plane at \(Q=(x,y,0)\). The angle between the ray \(\vec{OQ}\) and the \(x\)-axis is \(\theta\), and is called the azimuth angle. The angle between the ray \(\vec{OP}\) and the \(z\) axis is \(\phi\) (``phi''), and is called the inclination angle, polar angle, or zenith angle. Construct a graph in 3D of this information, and use it to develop the equations for spherical coordinates given above.%

\end{aside}
There is some disagreement between different fields about the notation for spherical coordinates. In some fields (like physics), \(\phi\) represents the azimuth angle and \(\theta\) represents the inclination angle. In some fields, like geography, instead of the inclination angle, the \emph{elevation} angle is given\textemdash{}the angle from the \(xy\)-plane (lines of lattitude are from the elevation angle). Additionally, sometimes the coordinates are written in a different order. You should always check the notation for spherical coordinates before communicating using them.%

You've finished the chapter! Look at the objectives at the beginning of the chapter. Can you now do all the things you were promised?%

\emph{Review Guide Creation}%
\par
Your assignment: organize what you've learned into a small collection of examples that illustrates the key concepts. I'll call this your chapter review guide. I'll provide you with a template which includes the chapter's key concepts from the objectives at the beginning. Once you finish your review guide, scan it into a PDF document (use any scanner on campus or photo software) and upload it to Gradescope. %
\par
As you create this review guide, consider the following: \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Before each Celebration of Knowledge  we will devote a class period to review. With well created lesson plans, you will have 4-8 pages(for 2-4 Chapters) to review for each, instead of 50-100 problems.%
\item{}Think ahead 2-5 years. If you make these lesson plans correctly, you'll be able to look back at your lesson plans for this semester. In about 20-25 pages, you can have the entire course summarized and easy for you to recall.%

\begin{objectives}{Objectives}\label{objectives-10}
In this section you will learn how to:%
%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}identify the domain and range of a multivariable or vector-valued function%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
A function is a set of instructions involving two sets (called the domain and codomain). A function assigns to each element of the domain \(D\) exactly one element in the codomain \(R\). We'll often refer to the codomain \(R\) as the target space. We'll write%
\begin{equation*}
f\colon D\to R
\end{equation*}
when we want to remind ourselves of the domain and target space. In this class, we will study what happens when the domain and target space are subsets of \({\mathbb{R}}^n\) (Euclidean \(n\)-space). In particular, we will study functions of the form%
\begin{equation*}
f\colon {\mathbb{R}}^n\to {\mathbb{R}}^m,
\end{equation*}
when \(m\) and \(n\) are 3 or less. The value of \(n\) is the dimension of the input vector (or number of inputs). The number \(m\) is the dimension of the output vector (or number of outputs). Our goal is to understand uses for each type of function, and be able to construct graphs to represent the function.%
\par
We will focus most of our time this semester on two- and three-dimensional problems. However, many problems in the real world require a higher number of dimensions. When you hear the word ``dimension'', it does not always represent a physical dimension, such as length, width, or height. If a quantity depends on 30 different measurements, then the problem involves 30 dimensions. As a quick illustration, the formula for the distance between two points depends on 6 numbers, so distance is really a 6-dimensional problem. As another example, if a piece of equipment has a color, temperature, age, and cost, we can think of that piece of equipment being represented by a point in four-dimensional space (where the coordinate axes represent color, temperature, age, and cost).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{prob_pebble}

Notice in the problem above that we placed a vector symbol above the function name, as in \(\vec r\colon {\mathbb{R}}^n\to {\mathbb{R}}^m\).

The jet from \hyperref[prob_jet_intro_for_space_curves]{Exercise~\ref{prob_jet_intro_for_space_curves}} is actually accompanied by several jets flying side by side. As all the jets fly, they leave a smoke trail behind them (it's an air show). The smoke from one jet spreads outwards to mix with the neighboring jet, so that it looks like the jets are leaving a rather wide sheet of smoke behind them as they fly.%
\par
The position of two of the many other jets is given by \(\vec r_3(t)=(3\cos t, 3\sin t, t)\) and \(\vec r_4(t)=(4\cos t,4\sin t,t)\). A function which represents the smoke stream is \(\vec r(a,t)=(a\cos t, a\sin t, t)\) for \(0\leq t\leq 4\pi\) and \(2\leq a\leq 4\).%

\end{enumerate}
\item\label{task-185} We said in the initial problem statement that the smoke spreads and merges. So we really want to plot \(\vec{r}(a,t)=(a\cos t, a\sin t, t)\) for \(2\leq a \leq 4\) at each \(t\) value.%

\emph{Contexual Aside:} The function above is called a parametric surface. Parametric surfaces are formed by joining together many parametric space curves. Most of 3D computer animation is done using parametric surfaces. Woody's entire body in \emph{Toy Story} is a collection of parametric surfaces. Car companies create computer models of vehicles using parametric surfaces, and then use those parametric surfaces to study collisions. Often the mathematics behind these models is hidden in the software program, but parametric surfaces are at the heart of just about every 3D computer model.%

In all the problems above, you should have noticed that in order to draw a function (provided you include arrows for direction, or use an animation to represent ``time''), you can determine how many dimensions you need to graph a function by just summing the dimensions of the domain and codomain. This is true in general.%

To do so, let \(u\) equal a constant (such as 1, 2, 3) and then graph the resulting space curve. Then let \(v\) equal a constant (such as 0, \(\pi/2\), etc.) and graph the resulting space curve until you can visualize the surface.%

\begin{exploration}[]\label{prob_3dsurface_plot}
A computer chip has been disconnected from electricity and sitting in cold storage for quite some time. The chip is connected to power, and a few moments later the temperature (in Celsius) at various points \((x,y)\) on the chip is measured. From these measurements, statistics is used to create a temperature function \(T=z=f(x,y)\) to model the temperature at any point on the chip. Suppose that this chip's temperature function is given by the equation \(T=z=f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2\). Eventually we'll be creating a 3D model of this function in this problem, so you'll need to place all your graphs on the same \(x,y,z\) axes. However, to begin with you may find it easier to start with several 2-D plots.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-200} What is the temperature at \((0,0)\), \((1,2)\), and \((-4,3)\)?%
\item\label{task-201} Let \(y=0\), Substitute this value into the temperature function \(T=z=f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2\). Plot the resulting function in the \(xz\)-plane.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad Treat \(z\) as ``y''. It should be a (upside-down) parabola%
\item\label{task-202} Now let \(x=0\). Substitute this value into the temperature function and simplify. Plot the result. This plot should appear in the \(yz\) plane and be another parabola.%
\item\label{task-203} Now let \(z=0\). Draw the resulting curve in the \(xy\) plane. If you drew the above curves in 2-D it is time to combine them. You should end up with 3 lines or a basic wire frame. To make a more complete wireframe we need to add more curves.%
\item\label{task-204} State the simplified equation, then plot and label the curves for the values below.%
\par

We'll be using the same function \(T=z=f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2\) as the previous problem. However, this time we'll construct a graph of the function by only studying places where the temperature is constant. We'll do this by creating a graph in 2D of the surface (similar to a topographical map).%

\item\label{task-211} Use your process to find the curve corresponding to a temperature of zero. Plot this curve in the \(xy\)-plane. Be sure to label it with \(T=0\) This curve is called a level curve. As long as you stay on this curve, your temperature will remain level, it will not increase nor decrease.%
\item\label{task-212} Which points in the plane have temperature \(z=5\)?  Add this level curve to your 2D plot and write \(z=5\) next to it.%
\item\label{task-213} Repeat the above for \(z=8\), \(z=9\), and \(z=1\).%
\item\label{task-214} What's wrong with letting \(z=10\)?%

A level curve of a function \(z=f(x,y)\) is a curve in the \(xy\)-plane found by setting the output \(z\) equal to a constant. Symbolically, a level curve of \(f(x,y)\) is the curve \(c=f(x,y)\) for some constant \(c\). A 2D plot consisting of several level curves is called a contour plot of \(z=f(x,y)\).%

Notice that when we graphed the previous two functions (of the form \(z=f(x,y)\)) we could either construct a 3D surface plot, or we could reduce the dimension by 1 and construct a 2D contour plot by letting the output \(z\) equal various constants.%
\par
The next function is of the form \(w=f(x,y,z)\), so it has 3 inputs and 1 output. We could write \(f\colon \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^1\). We would need 4 dimensions to graph this function, but graphing in 4D is not an easy task. Instead, we'll reduce the dimension and create plots in 3D to describe the level surfaces of the function.%

Consider the function \(w=f(x,y,z)=x^2+z^2\). This function has an input \(y\), but notice that changing the input \(y\) does not change the output of the function. This means that when \(y=0\) you can draw one curve. When \(y=1\), you should draw the same curve. When \(y=2\), again you draw the same curve, etc.%

Most of our examples of function of the form \(w=f(x,y,z)\) can be drawn by using our knowledge about conic sections. We can graph ellipses and hyperbolas if there are only two variables. So the key idea is to set one of the variables equal to a constant and then graph the resulting curve. Repeat this with a few variables and a few constants, and you'll know what the surface is. Sometimes when you set a specific variable equal to a constant, you'll get an ellipse. If this occurs, try setting that variable equal to other constants, as ellipses are generally the easiest curves to draw.%

We now know how to draw a vector field provided someone tells us the equation. How do we obtain an equation of a vector field? The following problem will help you develop the gravitational vector field.%
\begin{exploration}[Radial fields]\label{exploration-121}
Do the following:%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-240} Let \(P=(x,y,z)\) be a point in space. At that point, what is the \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) distance to the origin?%
\item\label{task-241} At the point \(P\), let \(\vec F(x,y,z)\) be the vector which points from \(P\) to the origin.  Give a formula for \(\vec F(x,y,z)\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad An object following this vector would travel from the point to the origin%
\item\label{task-242} Give an equation of the vector field where at each point \(P\) in the plane, the vector \(\vec F_2(P)\) is a unit vector that points towards the origin.%
\item\label{task-243} Give an equation of the vector field where at each point \(P\) in the plane, the vector \(\vec F_3(P)\) is a vector of length 7 that points towards the origin.%
\end{enumerate}
\bigbreak
Use the SageMath Cell below to plot your vector fields. Note: The current input is NOT the same as the field above, modify it to reflect the fields you found.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
F(x,y,z) = (y,z,x)
plot_vector_field3d(F, (x,-3,3), (y,-3,3),(z,-3,3))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{exploration}
If someone gives us parametric equations for a curve in the plane, we know how to draw the curve. How do we obtain parametric equations of a given curve? In \hyperref[prob_parametric_curve_in_plane]{Exercise~\ref{prob_parametric_curve_in_plane}}, we were given the parametric equation for the path of a horse, namely \(x=2\cos t, y=3 \sin t\) or \(\vec r(t)=(2\cos t,3\sin t)\). From those equations, we drew the path of the horse, and could have written a Cartesian equation for the path. How do we work this in reverse, namely if we had only been given the ellipse \(\ds\frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{y^2}{9}=1\), could we have obtained parametric equations \(\vec r(t)=(x(t),y(t))\) for the curve?%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-122}
Give a parametrization of the straight line from \((a,0)\) to \((0,b)\). You can write your parametrization in the vector form \(\vec r(t)=(?,?)\), or in the parametric form \(x=?,\ y=?\). Remember to include bounds for \(t\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad \hyperref[prob_line_equation_practice]{Review~\ref{prob_line_equation_practice}}.%
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-123}
Give a parametrization of the parabola \(y=x^2\) from \((-1,1)\) to \((2,4)\). Remember the bounds for \(t\).%
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-124}
Give a parametrization of the function \(y=f(x)\) for \(x\in[a,b]\). You can write your parametrization in the vector form \(\vec r(t)=(?,?)\), or in the parametric form \(x=?,\ y=?\). Include bounds for \(t\).%
\end{exploration}
If someone gives us parametric equations for a surface, we can draw the surface. This is what we did in \hyperref[prob_parametric_surface_example]{Exercise~\ref{prob_parametric_surface_example}} and \hyperref[second_parametric_surface_example]{Exercise~\ref{second_parametric_surface_example}}. How do we work backwards and obtain parametric equations for a given surface? This requires that we write an equation for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of two input variables (See \hyperref[prob_parametric_surface_example]{Exercise~\ref{prob_parametric_surface_example}} and \hyperref[second_parametric_surface_example]{Exercise~\ref{second_parametric_surface_example}} for examples). In vector form, we need a function \(\vec r\colon \mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^3\). We can often use a coordinate transformation \(\vec T\colon \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^3\) to obtain a parametrization of a surface.%
\par
The next three problems show how to do this.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{x3d_parametric_plot}
Consider the surface \(z=9-x^2-y^2\) plotted in \hyperref[prob_3dsurface_plot]{Exercise~\ref{prob_3dsurface_plot}}.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-244} Using the rectangular coordinate transformation \(\vec T(x,y,z)=(x,y,z)\), give a parametrization \(\vec r\colon \mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^3\) of the surface. This is the same as saying%
\begin{equation*}
x=x, y=y, z=?.
\end{equation*}
%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad Use the surface equation to eliminate the input variable \(z\) in \(T\).%
\item\label{task-245} What bounds must you place on \(x\) and \(y\) to obtain the portion of the surface above the plane \(z=0\)?%
\item\label{general_param_3d} If \(z=f(x,y)\) is any surface, give a parametrization of the surface (i.e., \(x=?, y=?, z=?\) or \(\vec r (?,?)=(?,?,?)\).)%
\end{enumerate}
\bigbreak
Use \href{http://wolfr.am/zk2KTu}{Wolfram Alpha} or the SageMath cell below to plot the parameterizations.%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=sageinput]
T(x,y,z) = (x,y,z)
print "T(z=x+y) is", T(z=x+y)
parametric_plot(T(z=x+y), (x,-3,3), (y,-3,3))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-126}
Again consider the surface \(z=9-x^2-y^2\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-247} Using cylindrical coordinates, \(\vec T(r,\theta,z) = (r\cos \theta, r\sin\theta, z)\), obtain a parametrization \(\vec r(r,\theta)=(?,?,?)\) of the surface using the input variables \(r\) and \(\theta\). In other words, if we let \(x=r\cos \theta, y=r\sin\theta, z=z\), write \(z=9-x^2-y^2\) in terms of \(r\) and \(\theta\).%
\item\label{task-248} What bounds must you place on \(r\) and \(\theta\) to obtain the portion of the surface above the plane \(z=0\)?%
\end{enumerate}
\bigbreak
Use the SageMath Cell or \href{http://wolframalpha.com}{Wolfram Alpha} to plot your parametrization with your bounds (See \hyperref[x3d_parametric_plot]{Exercise~5} for examples).%

\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-127}
Recall the spherical coordinate transformation as given in \hyperref[graphing_spherical_coordinates]{Exercise~\ref{graphing_spherical_coordinates}}.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-32}
%
\begin{equation*}
\vec T(\rho,\phi,\theta) = (\rho\sin\phi\cos \theta, \rho\sin\phi\sin \theta,\rho \cos \phi).
\end{equation*}
%
\end{aside}
This is a function of the form \(\vec T\colon \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^3\). If we hold one of the three inputs constant, then we have a function of the form \(\vec r\colon \mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^3\), which is a parametric surface.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-249} Give a parametrization of the sphere of radius 2, using \(\phi\) and \(\theta\) as your input variables.%
\item\label{task-250} What bounds should you place on \(\phi\) and \(\theta\) if you want to hit each point on the sphere exactly once?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad There are two possible answers here%
\item\label{task-251} What bounds should you place on \(\phi\) and \(\theta\) if you only want the portion of the sphere above the plane \(z=1\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad There are also two possible answers here%

Sometimes you'll have to invent your own coordinate system when constructing parametric equations for a surface. If you notice that there are lots of circles parallel to one of the coordinate planes, try using a modified version of cylindrical coordinates. Instead of circles in the \(xy\) plane (\(x=r\cos\theta,y=r\sin\theta,z=z\)), maybe you need circles in the \(yz\)-plane (\(x=x,y=r\sin\theta,z=r\sin\theta\)) or the \(xz\) plane. Just look for lots of circles, and then construct your parametrization accordingly.%

Construct a graph of the surface \(z = x^2-y^2\). Do so in 2 ways. (1) Construct a 3D surface plot. (2) Construct a contour plot, which is a graph with several level curves. Which level curve passes through the point \((3,4)\)? Use Wolfram Alpha to know if you're right. Just type ``plot z=x\^2-y\^2.''%
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-130}
Construct a plot of the vector field%
\begin{equation*}
\vec F(x,y) = (x+y, -x+1)
\end{equation*}
by graphing the field at many integer points around the origin (I generally like to get the 8 integer points around the origin, and then a few more). Then explain how to modify your graph to obtain a plot of the vector field%
\begin{equation*}
\hat F(x,y) = \frac{(x+y, -x+1)}{\sqrt{(x+y)^2+(1-x)^2}}.

Your assignment: organize what you've learned into a small collection of examples that illustrates the key concepts. I'll call this your chapter review guide. I'll provide you with a template which includes the chapter's key concepts from the objectives at the beginning. Once you finish your review guide, scan it into a PDF document (use any scanner on campus or photo software) and upload it to Gradescope. %

We'll find that throughout this course, the key difference between first-semester calculus and multivariate calculus is that we replace the input \(x\) and output \(y\) of functions with the vectors \(\vec x\) and \(\vec y\). For the function \(f(x,y)=z\), we can write \(f\) in the vector notation \(\vec y=\vec f(\vec x)\) if we let \(\vec x=(x,y)\) and \(\vec y=(z)\).

\begin{objectives}{Objectives}\label{objectives-13}
In this section we will...%
%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}understand differentials in matrix notation%
\item{}learn to compute partial and total derivatives%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
Before we introduce multi-dimensional derivatives, let's recall the definition of a differential. If \(y=f(x)\) is a function, then we say the differential \(dy\) is the expression \(dy=f'(x) dx\). We could also write this as \(dy = \frac{dy}{dx}dx\). Similarly, if \(w=g(t)\) then we have the derivative as \(\frac{dw}{dt}=g'(t)\) and the differential as \(dw=g'(t)dt\).%
\begin{observation}[]\label{observation-1}
Here's the key. Think of differential notation \(dy=f'(x)dx\) in the following way:%
\par
\emph{A change in the output \(y\) equals the derivative multiplied by  a change in the input \(x\). To get \(dy\), we just need the derivative times \(dx\).}%
\par
To get the derivative in all dimensions, we just substitute in vectors to obtain the differential notation \(d\vec y = f'(\vec x) d\vec x\). The derivative is precisely the thing that tells us how to get \(d\vec y\) from \(d\vec x\). We'll quickly see that \(f'(\vec x)\) must be a matrix, and then we'll start calling it \(Df\) instead of \(f'\).%
\end{observation}
Let's now examine some exercises you have seen before.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{prob_differential_volume_of_a_cylinder}
The volume of a right circular cylinder is \(V(r,h)= \pi r^2 h\). Imagine that each of \(V\), \(r\), and \(h\) depends on \(t\) (we might be collecting rain water in a can, or crushing a cylindrical concentrated juice can, etc.).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

\end{enumerate}
\item\label{task-265} In which of the equations from part (a) does \(h\) NOT change as time changes?%
\item\label{task-266} If the height remains constant, what is \(dV/dt\) in terms of \(dr/dt\)? Times both sides by \(dt\) to obtain a formula for \(dV\) when \(h\) is constant.%
\item\label{task-267} If the radius remains constant, what is \(dV/dt\) in terms of \(dh/dt\)? What is \(dV\) when \(r\) is constant?%
\item\label{task-268} If neither the radius nor height remains constant, what is \(dV/dt\) in terms of \(dh/dt\)? Solve for \(dV\).%

\subsection[{Developing the Derivative}]{Developing the Derivative}\label{subsection-29}
Part (d) in each exercise above is the KEY idea, let me repeat, THE KEY IDEA, to the rest of this course. It all goes back to differentials. We can compute a small change in volume, if we know how much the radius and height have changed, or if we know how much the length, width, and height will change.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-134}
Use matrix multiplication to answer the following questions.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-277} \begin{aside}{}\label{aside-36}
Make sure you ask me in class to show you physically exactly how you can see these differential formulas.%
\end{aside}
In \hyperref[prob_differential_volume_of_a_cylinder]{Exercise~1} we showed that a change in the volume of a cylinder is approximately%
\begin{equation*}
dV = \begin{bmatrix}2\pi rh\amp  \pi r^2
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}dr\\dh
\end{bmatrix} .
\end{equation*}
If we know that \(r=3\) and \(h=4\), and we know that \(r\) could going to increase by about \(.1\) and \(h\) could increase by about \(.2\), then by about how much will \(V\) increase by?%
\item\label{task-278} The volume of a box is given by \(V=xyz\). From \hyperref[prob_volumebox]{Exercise~2} we know the differential of the volume is \(V=\begin{bmatrix}yz\amp  xz \amp  xy
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}dx\\dy\\dz
\end{bmatrix}\). If the current measurements are \(x=2\), \(y=3\), and \(z=5\), and we know that \(dx=.01\), \(dy=.02\), and \(dz=.03\), then by about how much will the volume increase.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
In more general terms, we can compute the change in a function \(f(x,y)\) if we know how much \(x\) and \(y\) will change.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{unit6_content}
Consider the function \(f(x,y) = x^2y +3x+4\sin(5y)\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-279} If both \(x\) and \(y\) depend on \(t\), then use implicit differentiation to obtain a formula for \(df/dt\) in terms of \(dx/dt\) and \(dy/dt\). This will be the last time we use implicit differentiation.%
\item\label{task-280} Solve for \(df\), and write your answer as the matrix product (fill in the blank)%
\begin{equation*}
df = \begin{bmatrix}?\amp  x^2+20\cos(5y)
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}dx\\dy
\end{bmatrix} .
\end{equation*}
%
\item\label{task-281} If you hold \(y\) constant, then what is \(df/dx\)?%
\item\label{task-282} If you hold \(x\) constant, then what is \(df/dy\)?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\hyperref[unit6_content]{Exercise~4} is precisely the content to this chapter. We just need to add some vocabulary to make it easier to talk about what we just did. Let's introduce the vocabulary in terms of the exercise above, and then make a formal definition. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The derivative of \(f\) in the previous exercise is the matrix%
\begin{equation*}
Df(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}2xy+3\amp  
x^2+20\cos(5y)
\end{bmatrix} .
\end{equation*}
Some people call this the total derivative, as it's made up of two parts, called partial derivatives.%
\item{}The first column of this matrix is just part of the whole derivative. We can get the first column by holding \(y\) constant, and then differentiating with respect to \(x\). This is precisely a partial derivative.  We'll write this as \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xy+3\), or sometimes just \(f_x = 2xy+3\).%
\item{}The second column of the derivative is the partial of \(f\) with respect to \(y\). We can get the second column by holding \(x\) constant, and then differentiating with respect to \(y\). We'll write this as \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x^2+20\cos(5y)\), or \(f_y = x^2+20\cos(5y)\).%
\item{}Remember, the derivative of \(f\) is a matrix. The columns of the matrix are the partial derivatives with respect to the input variables.%
\end{itemize}
%
\begin{definition}[{Derivatives and Partial Derivatives}]\label{definition-23}
Let \(f\) be a function. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The partial derivative of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) is the regular derivative of \(f\), provided we hold every every input variable constant except \(x\). (This is what we did in the first parts of \hyperref[prob_differential_volume_of_a_cylinder]{exercises~1} and \hyperref[prob_volumebox]{Exercise~2}.  We'll use the notations%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[f],
f_x,
\text{ and } D_x f
\end{equation*}
to mean the partial of \(f\) with respect to \(x\).%
\item{}The partial of \(f\) with respect to \(y\), written \(\ds \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\) or \(f_y\), is the regular derivative of \(f\), provided we hold every input variable constant except \(y\). A similar definition holds for partial derivatives with respect to any variable.%
\item{}The derivative of \(f\) is a matrix. The columns of the derivative are the partial derivatives. When there's more than one input variable, we'll use \(Df\) rather than \(f'\) to talk about derivatives.  The order of the columns must match the order you list the variables in the function. If the function is \(f(x,y)\), then the derivative is \(Df(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\amp \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix} .\) If the function is \(V(x,y,z)\), then the derivative is \(DV(x,y,z) = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\amp \frac{\partial V}{\partial y}\amp \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}
\end{bmatrix} .\)%
\end{itemize}

It's time to practice these new words on some exercises. Remember, we're doing the exact same thing as before the definitions above. Now we just have some vocabulary which makes it much easier to talk about differentiation.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-136}
Compute the requested partial and total derivatives.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-37}
I strongly suggest you practice a lot of this type of exercise until you can compute partial derivatives with ease.%
\end{aside}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-283} For \(f(x,y)=x^2+2xy+3y^2\), compute both \(\ds\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\) and \(f_y\). Then state \(Df(x,y)\).%
\item\label{task-284} For \(f(x,y,z)=x^2y^3z^4\), compute all three of \(f_x\), \(\ds\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\), and \(D_z f\). Then state \(Df(x,y,z)\).%
\end{enumerate}
\bigbreak
Remember, the partial derivative of a function with respect to \(x\) is just the regular derivative with respect to \(x\), provided you hold all other variables constant. We put the partials into the columns of a matrix to obtain the (total) derivative.%
\end{exploration}
Please take a moment and practice computing partial and total derivatives. Your textbook has lots of examples to help you with partial derivatives. However, the textbook leaves out the actual derivative. This \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Maw2KW9k9aYlBnN0p4Z3MyREk/view?usp=sharing}{handwritten file (follow the link)} has 6 exercises, together with solutions, that you can use as extra practice for total derivatives. Please open the file before moving on.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-137}
Compute the requested partial and total derivatives.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-285} Consider the parametric surface \(\vec r(u,v) = (u,v,v\cos(uv))\). Compute both \(\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial u}\) and \(\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial v}\). Then state \(D\vec r(u,v)\). If you end up with a 3 by 2 matrix, you did this correctly.%
\item\label{task-286} Consider the vector field \(\vec F(x,y) = (-y,xe^{3y})\). Compute both \(\ds\frac{\partial \vec F}{\partial x}\) and \(\ds\frac{\partial \vec F}{\partial y}\). Then state \(D\vec F(x,y)\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
As you completed the exercises above, did you notice any connections between the size of the matrix and the size of the input and output vectors? Make sure you ask in class about this. We'll make a connection.%
\par
We've now seen that the derivative of \(z=f(x,y)\) is a matrix \(Df(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}f_x \amp  f_y
\end{bmatrix}\). This is a function itself that has inputs \(x\) and \(y\), and outputs \(f_x\) and \(f_y\). This means it has 2 inputs and 2 outputs, so it's a vector field. What does the vector field tell us about the original function?%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-138}
Consider the function \(f(x,y)=y-x^2\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-287} In the \(xy\) plane, please draw several level curves of \(f\) (maybe \(z=0\), \(z=1\), \(z=-4\), etc.)  Write the height on each curve (so you're making a topographical map).%
\item\label{task-288} Compute the derivative of \(f\). (Remember this is now a vector field.)%
\item\label{task-289} Pick several points in the \(xy\) plane that lie on the level curves you already drew.  At these points, add the vector given by the derivative.  (So at (0,0), you'll need to draw the vector (0,1).  At (1,1), you'll need to draw the vector (-2,1).) Add 8 vectors to your picture, and then write down to share with the class any observations you make.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
We'll come back to this exercise more in chapter 9 as we discuss optimization. There are lots of connections between the derivative and level curves.%

Let's now explain geometrically what a partial derivative is. The next few exercises will help with this.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-139}
Consider the change of coordinates \(\vec T(r,\theta) = (r\cos \theta, r\sin \theta)\).%

\item\label{task-291} State the derivative \(D\vec T(r,\theta)\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad If you get a 2 by 2 matrix, then you're on the right track. Each partial derivative is a vector. (This one is in the \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Maw2KW9k9aYlBnN0p4Z3MyREk/view?usp=sharing}{handwritten file} with extra practice.)%
\item\label{task-292} Consider the polar point \((r,\theta) = (4,\pi/2)\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\roman*),ref=\theenumi.\roman*]
\item\label{task-293} Compute \(T(4,\pi/2)\) (the Cartesian coordinate)%
\item\label{task-294} Compute both partial derivatives at \((4,\pi/2)\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad You should get a point and two vectors.%
\item\label{task-295} At the point, draw both vectors.%
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{task-296} If you were standing at the polar point \((4,\pi/2)\) and someone said, ``Hey you, keep your angle constant, but increase your radius,'' then which direction would you move?  What if someone said, ``Hey you, keep your radius constant, but increase your angle''?%
\item\label{task-297} Now change the polar point to \((r,\theta) = (2,3\pi/4)\).  Try, without doing  any computations, to repeat part 2 (at the point draw both partial derivatives). Explain.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
If your answers to the 2nd and 3rd part above were the same, then you're doing this correctly. The partial derivatives, when vectors, tell us precisely about motion. The next exercise reinforces this concept.%

If you know that a plane passes through the point \((1,2,3)\) and has normal vector \((4,5,6)\), then give an equation of the plane. See\footnote{An equation of the plane is \(4(x-1)+5(y-2)+6(y-3)=0\). If \((x,y,z)\) is any point in the plane, then the vector \((x-1,y-2,z-3)\) is a vector in the plane, and hence orthogonal to \((4,5,6)\). The dot product of these two vectors should be equal to zero, which is why the plane's equation is \((4,5,6)\cdot (x-1,y-2,z-3)=0\).\label{fn-2}}for an answer.%

Consider again the parametric surface \(\vec r(a,t) = (a\cos t, a\sin t, t)\) for \(2\leq a\leq 4\) and \(0\leq t\leq 4\pi\).%
\par
We'd like to obtain an equation of the tangent plane to this surface at the point \(\vec r(3,\pi)\). To find a plane we need a normal (orthogonal) vector to the [tangent] plane and a point.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-307} State the coordinates for \(\vec r (3,\pi)\)%
\item\label{task-308} Since \(\vec r_a (3,\pi)\) and \(\vec r_t (3, \pi)\) (the two partial derivatives) are tangent to the surface they must also be in our tangent plane. So a vector orthogonal to \(\vec r_a\) and \(\vec r_t\) will be normal to the tangent plane.%
\par
Find this normal vector.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad How do I obtain a vector orthogonal to both partial derivatives? Is it the scalar, dot, or cross product?%

\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
I promised earlier in this chapter that you can obtain most of the results in multivariate calculus by replacing the \(x\) and \(y\) in \(dy=f'dx\) with \(\vec x\) and \(\vec y\). The last exercise asked you to obtain a tangent plane to a parametric surface. You've never had to find a tangent plane to a function of the form \(z=f(x,y)\). Let's review how to do it for functions of the form \(y=f(x)\), and then generalize.%
\begin{project}[Tangent Lines]\label{prob_tangent_line1}

\item\label{task-312} and the output \(y\) is \(y=f(3)=?\).%
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{task-313} If we move from the point \((3,f(3))\) to the point \((x,y)\) along the tangent line, then a small change in \(x\) is \(dx=x-3\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\roman*),ref=\theenumi.\roman*]
\item\label{task-314} What is \(dy\) in terms of \(y\)?%
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{task-315} Differential notation states that a change in the output \(dy\) equals the derivative times a change in the input \(dx\), which gives us the equation \(dy=f'(3)dx\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\roman*),ref=\theenumi.\roman*]
\item\label{task-316} Replace \(dx\), \(dy\), and \(f'(3)\) with what we know they equal, to obtain an equation \(y-?=?(x-?)\).%

We now have two different ways to compute tangent planes. One way generalizes differential notation \(dy=f'dx\) to \(dz = Df \begin{bmatrix}dx\\dy
\end{bmatrix}\) and then uses matrix multiplication. This way will extend to tangent objects in EVERY dimension. It's the key idea needed to work on really large exercises.%
\par
The other way requires that we parametrize the surface \(z=f(x,y)\) as \(\vec r(x,y)=(x,y,f(x,y))\) and then use the cross product on the partial derivatives. Both give the same answer. The next exercise has you give a general formula for a tangent plane. To tackle this exercise, you'll need to make sure you can use symbolic notation. The review exercise should help with this.%

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Compute partial and total derivatives of multivariable and vector functions: %
\begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
\item{}Find derivatives of composite functions, using the chain rule (matrix multiplication).%

\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
We'll now see how the chain rule generalizes to all dimensions. Just as before, we'll find that the first semester calculus rule will generalize to all dimensions, if we replace \(f'\) with the matrix \(Df\). Let's recall the chain rule from first-semester calculus.%
\begin{theorem}[{The Chain Rule}]\label{theorem-2}
Let \(x\) be a real number and \(f\) and \(g\) be functions of a single real variable. Suppose \(f\) is differentiable at \(g(x)\) and \(g\) is differentiable at \(x\). The derivative of \(f\circ g\) at \(x\) is%
\begin{equation*}
(f\circ g)'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(f\circ g)(x) = f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x).
\end{equation*}
%
\end{theorem}
Some people remember the theorem above as ``the derivative of a composition is the derivative of the outside (evaluated at the inside) multiplied by the derivative of the inside.'' If \(u=g(x)\), we sometimes write \(\ds \frac{df}{dx}=\frac{df}{du}\frac{du}{dx}\). The following exercise should help us master this notation.%
\begin{project}[]\label{prob_chain_rule_review}
Suppose we know that \(\ds f'(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{2x^2+3}\) and \(g(x)=\sqrt{x^2+1}\). Notice we don't know \(f(x)\).%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-44}

We now generalize to higher dimensions. If I want to write \(\vec f(\vec g(\vec x))\), then \(\vec x\) must be a vector in the domain of \(g\). After computing \(\vec g(\vec x)\), we must get a vector that is in the domain of \(f\).%
\par
Since the chain rule in first semester calculus states \((f(g(x))'=f'(g(x))g'(x)\), then in high dimension it should state \(D(f(g(x)) = Df(g(x))Dg(x)\), the product of two matrices.%

In \hyperref[prob_differential_volume_of_a_cylinder]{Exercise~\ref{prob_differential_volume_of_a_cylinder}}, we showed that for a circular cylinder with volume \(V=\pi r^2 h\), the derivative is%
\begin{equation*}
DV(r,h)=\begin{bmatrix}2\pi rh \amp  \pi r^2
\end{bmatrix} .
\end{equation*}
%

Recall that to get this derivative we assumed that the radius and height are both changing with respect to time. Now we actually use functions for each letting \(r=3t\) and \(h=t^2\). We'll write this parametrically as \(\vec x (t) = (r,h)(t) = (3t, t^2)\).%

Let's look at some physical examples involving motion and temperature, and try to connect what we know should happen to what the chain rule states.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{horse_track_chain_rule_introduction}
Consider \(f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2\) and \(\vec r(t)=(2\cos t, 3\sin t)\). Imagine the following scenario. A horse runs around outside in the cold. The horse's position at time \(t\) is given parametrically by the elliptical path \(\vec r(t)\). The function \(T=f(x,y)\) gives the temperature of the air at any point \((x,y)\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{item_1} At time \(t=0\), what is the horse's position \(\vec r(0)\), and what is the temperature \(f(\vec r(0))\) at that position?%
\item\label{task-341} Find the temperatures at \(t=\pi/2\), \(t=\pi\), and \(t=3\pi/2\) as well.%
\item\label{task-342} In the plane, draw the path of the horse for \(t\in [0,2\pi]\).%
\item\label{task-343} \begin{aside}{}\label{aside-45}
If you end up with an ellipse and several concentric circles, then you've done this right.%
\end{aside}
On the same 2D graph, include a contour plot of the temperature function \(f\). Make sure you include the level curves that pass through the points in \hyperref[item_1]{part~a}, and write the temperature on each level curve you draw.%
\item\label{task-344} \begin{aside}{}\label{aside-46}
This idea leads to an optimization technique, Lagrange multipliers, later in the semester.%
\end{aside}
As the horse runs around, the temperature of the air around the horse is constantly changing. At which \(t\) does the temperature around the horse reach a maximum?  A minimum?  Explain, using your graph.%
\item\label{item_2} As the horse moves past the point at \(t=\pi/4\), is the temperature of the surrounding air increasing or decreasing? In other words, is \(\dfrac{df}{dt}\) positive or negative? Use your graph to explain.%
\item\label{task-346} We'll complete this part in class, but you're welcome to give it a try yourself. Draw the 3D surface plot of \(f\). In the \(xy\)-plane of your 3D plot (so \(z=0\)) add the path of the horse. In class, we'll project the path of the horse up into the 3D surface.%
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-150}
Consider again \(f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2\) and \(\vec r(t)=(2\cos t, 3\sin t)\), which means \(x=2\cos t\) and \(y=3\sin t\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-347} At the point \(\vec r(t)\), we'd like a formula for the temperature \(f(\vec r(t))\). What is the temperature of the horse at any time \(t\)? [In \(f(x,y)\), replace \(x\) and \(y\) with what they are in terms of \(t\).]%

\subsection[{Formally Defining the Chain Rule}]{Formally Defining the Chain Rule}\label{subsection-37}
The previous three exercises all focused on exactly the same concept. The first looked at the concept graphically, showing what it means to write \((f\circ \vec r)(t)=f(\vec r(t))\). The second reduced the exercise to first-semester calculus. The third tackled the exercise by considering matrix derivatives. In all three cases, we wanted to understand the following question:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-2}{}
If \(z=f(x,y)\) is a function of \(x\) and \(y\), and both \(x\) and \(y\) are functions of \(t\) ( \(\vec r(t)=(x(t),y(t))\)), then how do we discover how quickly \(f\) changes as we change \(t\). In other words, what is the derivative of \(f\) with respect to \(t\). Notationally, we seek \(\ds \frac{df}{dt}\) which we formally write as \(\ds \frac{d}{dt}[f(x(t),y(t))]\) or \(\ds \frac{d}{dt} [f(\vec r(t))].\)%
\end{quote}
To answer this question, we use the chain rule, which is just matrix multiplication.%
\begin{theorem}[{The Chain Rule}]\label{def_chain_rule}
Let \(\vec x\) be a vector and \(\vec f\) and \(\vec g\) be functions so that the composition \(\vec f(\vec g(\vec x))\) makes sense (we can use the output of \(g\) as an input to \(f\)). Suppose \(\vec f\) is differentiable at \(\vec g(\vec x)\) and that \(\vec g\) is differentiable at \(\vec x\). Then the derivative of \(\vec f\circ \vec g\) at \(\vec x\) is%
\begin{equation*}
D(\vec f\circ \vec g)(\vec x) = D\vec f(\vec g(\vec x))\cdot D\vec g(\vec x).
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The derivative of a composition is equal to the derivative of the outside (evaluated at the inside), multiplied by the derivative of the inside.%
\end{theorem}
This is exactly the same as the chain rule in first-semester calculus. The only difference is that now we have vectors above every variable and function, and we replaced the one-by-one matrices \(f'\) and \(g'\) with potentially larger matrices \(Df\) and \(Dg\). If we write everything in vector notation, the chain rule in all dimensions is the EXACT same as the chain rule in one dimension.%

You've now got the key ideas needed to use the chain rule in all dimensions. You'll find this shows up many places in upper-level math, physics, and engineering courses.

\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-157}
Suppose \(z=f(x,y)\). If \(z\) is held constant, this produces a level curve. As an example, if \(f(x,y) = x^2+3xy-y^3\) then \(5=x^2+3xy-y^3\) is a level curve. Our goal in this exercise is to find \(dy/dx\) in terms of partial derivatives of \(f\).%

\section[{Optional: Projectile Motion}]{Optional: Projectile Motion}\label{ch08_01_projmotion}
Have you ever dropped a rock from the top of a waterfall, or skipped a rock across a lake. This section explores some simple connections between position, velocity, and acceleration. If we wanted to send a rocket to space, or shoot a missile across an ocean, the same principles will apply. If we know how much thrust a rocket provides (the acceleration), can we determine the velocity of our rocket at any time along its path? Could we predict the flight path of the rocket? To make a good flight plan, we'd need to know how to determine position and velocity from acceleration. That's the content of this section.%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-7}
If \(y'(t) = 3t^2+12e^{2t}\) (the velocity) and \(y(0)=2\) (initial height), then what is \(y(t)\)? See footnote\footnote{Integrate to get \(y(t) = t^3+6e^{2t}+C\). Since \(y(0)=2\), we know \(2=0+6(1)+C\), which gives \(C=-4\). So the height is \(y(t) = t^3+6e^{2t}-4\).\label{fn-6}}for an answer.%
\end{project}
To solve the next exercise, we need to know that acceleration is the derivative of velocity, and that velocity is the derivative of position. These facts hold true for vector-valued functions as well.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-158}
Consider a rocket in space (so we can neglect air resistance and gravity). The rocket's boosters apply an acceleration \(\vec a(t) = (2t,-8)\) m/s\(^2\). The rocket's initial velocity is \(\vec v(0) = (4,5)\) m/s. The initial position is \(\vec r(0) = (1,16)\) m. Use this information to determine the position of the object after 2 seconds, and after 3 seconds.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad Integrate each component to get velocity, then repeat to get position. Don't forget the 4 arbitrary constants you get from integration. Use the initial velocity and initial position to determine these constants.%
\end{exploration}
Suppose we fire a projectile (like a pumpkin) from a cannon. The projectile leaves the cannon with an initial speed \(v_0\), at an angle of \(\alpha\) above the \(x\)-axis. All the motion in this exercise occurs within a plane, and we'll use \(x\) and \(y\) to represent motion in that plane. Our goal is to find the velocity \(\vec v(t)\) and position \(\vec r(t)\) of the projectile at any time \(t\).%
\par
We need some assumptions prior to solving. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Assume the only force acting on the object is the force due to gravity. We will neglect air resistance.%
\item{}The force due to gravity is the mass of the projectile multiplied by the acceleration of gravity. The mass of the object will not be important in our work here, though in future classes you may study how mass affects energy computations.%
\item{}The projectile is shot over a small enough range that we can assume gravity only pulls the object straight down.%
\item{}Most branches of science use the letter \(g\) to represent the magnitude of the vertical component of acceleration, so we can write the acceleration of the projectile as%
\begin{equation*}
\vec a(t) = (0,-g)   \text{ or }   \vec a(t)= 0\textbf{i}-g\textbf{j}.
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}Our text uses the approximations \(g\approx 9.8\) m/s\(^2\) or \(g\approx32\) ft/s\(^2\).%

You've probably heard before that when you throw a baseball to a friend, the path of the baseball is parabolic. The next exercise proves this. If you feel shaky on getting a Cartesian equation from a parametrization, please tackle this review exercise, otherwise, jump straight to the exercise.%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-8}
The function \(\vec r(t) = (2t+3, 4t^2+7t+5)\) is a parametrization of a plane curve. Give a Cartesian equation of the curve. See\footnote{Since \(t=\dfrac{x-3}{2}\), a Cartesian equation is \(y = 4\left(\dfrac{x-3}{2}\right)^2+7\left(\dfrac{x-3}{2}\right)+5\).\label{fn-7}}for an answer.%

\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-159}
Suppose a projectile is fired from the point \((x_0,y_0)\) with an initial velocity \(\vec v(0)=(v_{x_0},v_{y_0})\), and that gravity is the only force acting on the object. This means the acceleration on the object is \(\vec a(t) = (0,-g)\).%

If a projectile starts at \((x_0,y_0)\), we can move the origin to this point. As long as we are not trying to gauge the location of two projectiles simultaneously, we could always make the origin \((0,0)\) our starting point. We make the following definitions for a projectile that starts at \((0,0)\) and hits the ground at \((R,0)\). \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The range is the horizontal distance \(R\) traveled by the projectile.%
\item{}The flight time is how long the projectile is in the air. It is the time \(t\) at which \(\vec r(t)=(R,0)\).%

An archer stands at ground level and shoots an arrow at an object which is 90 feet away in the horizontal direction and 74 ft above ground. The arrow leaves the bow at about 6 ft above ground level (not the origin). The archer wants the arrow to hit the target at the peak of its parabolic path. For the purposes of this exercise, Let \(g = 32 \text{ ft } /\text{s} ^2\). What initial speed \(v_0\) and firing angle \(\alpha\) are needed to achieve this result?%

The previous section developed a way to predict position and velocity from acceleration, let's look more in depth at the actual path taken by a projectile. We'll need to be able to compute the actual distance an object travels (not the displacement, but the distance). This requires that we study arc length. This was covered for curves in the plane in chapter's 3 and 4. (\hyperref[arc_length_formula]{See~\ref{exploration-80}.\ref{arc_length_formula}})%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-9}
A horse runs once around an elliptical track, which is parametrized by \(\vec r(t) = (3\cos t,4\sin t)\). Set up, do not solve, an integral formula that tells us the distance the horse traveled. What's the displacement?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The velocity is \(\vec v(t) = (3\sin t, -4\cos t)\). The speed is \(v(t) = \sqrt{9\sin^2t+16\cos^2t}\). The distance traveled is the arc length \(\ds s=\int_0^{2\pi} \left(\sqrt{9\sin^2t+16\cos^2t}\right)dt\). Since the horse's initial and final position are equal, the displacement is zero. Arc length does not equal displacement.%
\end{project}
Let's now develop a formula for the arc length of a space curve, a curve in 3D. We can always parameterize a space curve with \(\vec r(t) = (x,y,z)\) (one input, 3 outputs).%
\par
Remember: When we talk about speed and velocity it is importation to recognize their differences. Velocity has direction and (often components) while speed is the total movement or the magnitude of the velocity.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-162}
A space ship travels through the galaxy. Let \(\vec r(t) = (x,y,z)\) be the position of the space ship at time \(t\), with the earth at the origin \((0,0,0)\).%

\par
Technically, we should write \(\vec r(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))\). However, we already know that \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) depend on \(t\), hence we'll just leave the dependence on \(t\) off.%
\end{aside}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-379} What are the velocity and speed of the space ship at time \(t\)? You answers should involve some derivatives (such as \(\frac{dx}{dt}\)).%
\item\label{task-380} If the space ship travels for a really small time \(dt\), then the speed is about constant. Since distance is speed times time, about how much distance (we'll call it \(ds\)) will the space ship travel in this short amount of time?%
\item\label{arc_length2} As the ship travels from time \(t=a\) to time \(t=b\), explain why the distance traveled (the arc length of the path followed) is%

\subsection[{Making 'Nice' Space-Curves}]{Making 'Nice' Space-Curves}\label{subsection-40}
In all our work that follows, we want to consider space curves that have nice smooth paths. What does this mean? We want to be able to compute tangent vectors at any point, so we will require that a parametrization \(\vec r\) be differentiable. However, this isn't enough.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-163}
We've encountered the polar curve \(r = 1-\sin\theta\) before (we called it a cardioid, and it looked like heart). Recall that we can switch from polar to Cartesian using the coordinate transformation \(x=r\cos\theta\) and \(y=r\sin\theta\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-382} Draw the curve.%
\item\label{task-383} Give the parametrization of this curve: \(\vec r(\theta) = ((1-\sin\theta)\cos\theta, ?)\).%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-52}
The parametrization is completely differentiable.%
\end{aside}
\item\label{task-384} Find \(\dfrac{d\vec r}{d\theta}\).%
\item\label{task-385} You should notice a sharp cusp in the graph. At what \(\theta\) does this cusp occur?  What is the value of the derivative \(\dfrac{d\vec r}{d\theta}\) at this value of \(\theta\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
We'd like to avoid paths that contain a cusp, because at a cusp the direction of motion changes rather abruptly. This can happen physically, but it requires the speed of an object to reach zero, the object stops moving, and then the path changes direction. The fact that the speed reaches zero will mean we can't divide by it in our work that follows. To avoid this, we make a definition that requires the path is differentiable, and the velocity is never zero.%
\begin{definition}[{Smooth Curves}]\label{def_smooth_curve}
Let \(\vec r(t)=(x,y,z)\) be a parametrization of a space curve \(C\). We say that \(\vec r\) is smooth if \(\vec r\) is differentiable, and the derivative is never the zero vector. If \(\vec r\) is a smooth parameterization, then we call \(C\) a smooth curve.%

\item\label{task-390} Now give a vector of length 1 that is tangent to the curve at \(t=2\pi\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
In the previous exercise, you developed two big ideas. You showed how to obtain a unit tangent vector to a curve. You also developed a formula for the length of a curve from time \(t=0\) to any time \(t=t\). This gives us a function \(s(t)\) that tells us how far we have traveled after \(t\) seconds. We can now predict distance traveled from time. Predicting the future is powerful. Before moving on, let's examine the derivative of \(s(t)\), because it's a quantity we already know.%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-10}
Compute \(\ds \int_0^t 3x^2 dx\) and \(\ds \int_0^t 3p^2 dp\) and \(\ds \int_0^t 3\tau^2 d\tau\). Does it matter what you call the variable inside the integral? Then compute \(\ds\frac{d}{dt} \int_0^t 3\tau^2 d\tau\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The first integral is \(x^3|_0^t = t^3\). The other two are the same. You can change the variable inside the integral whenever you want.  For this reason, some people call it a dummy variable. The last part is \(\ds\frac{d}{dt} \int_0^t 3\tau^2 d\tau = \frac{d}{dt} t^3 = 3t^2\), we just replaced \(\tau\) with \(t\) in \(3\tau^2\).%

\begin{exploration}[]\label{fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_as_it_applies_to_arc_length_parameter}
Let \(\vec r(t)=(x,y,z)\) be a parametrization of a smooth space curve. Let \(\ds s(t)=\int_0^t \left|\frac {d\vec r}{d\tau} \right|\ d\tau\).%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-54}
You can remember \(\ds\frac{ds}{dt} = \left|\frac {d\vec r}{dt} \right|\) as follows. We use the differential \(ds\) to represents a change in distance, and \(dt\) represents a change in time. So the speed of an object is the change in distance \(ds\) over the change in time \(dt\).%
\end{aside}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-391} Explain why \(\ds\frac{ds}{dt} = \left|\frac {d\vec r}{dt} \right|\), the speed.%
\item\label{task-392} Now explain why \(s(t)\) is an increasing function.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad Look up the fundamental theorem of calculus. To answer why is \(s\) increasing, what does ``smooth'' mean?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
We'll call \(\ds s(t)=\int_0^t \left|\frac {d\vec r}{d\tau}\right|\ d\tau\) the arc length parameter. It tells us how far we have traveled after \(t\) seconds. We can now predict distance traveled from time elapsed. Because \(s(t)\) is an increasing function, we can also invert this process and give time elapsed from distance traveled. This means we could compute derivatives with respect to \(s\) instead of \(t\). When we take a derivative with respect to \(s\), we ask how much a curve changes if we increase length by 1 unit, instead of increasing time by 1 unit. We'll write%
\begin{equation*}
\ds\frac{d\vec r}{ds} =\ds\frac{d\vec r/dt}{ds/dt} = \frac{d\vec r/dt}{|d\vec r/dt|} = \frac{\vec v}{|\vec{v}|}.

This is exactly the same as a unit vector in the same direction as the velocity.%
\end{definition}
As we progress through this unit, one of our key goals is to learn new notation. We've got position \(\vec r\), velocity \(\vec v\), speed \(v\) or \(ds/dt\), acceleration \(\vec a\), the unit tangent vector \(\vec T\), and the derivative of position with respect to arc length \(d\vec r/ds\). The last two are the exact same since \(\vec T = d\vec r/ds\). Did you also notice that \(ds/dt\) and \(v\) are both the speed? We'll need to start realizing that the same quantity can be developed in many ways.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-167}
Suppose an object moves along the space curve given by \(\vec r(t)=(a\cos t,a\sin t,b t)\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-398} Find the object's velocity and speed. What is \(ds/dt\)?%
\item\label{task-399} Compute \(\frac{d\vec r}{ds}\), the derivative of \(\vec r\) with respect to arc length. Leave your answer in terms of \(t\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad Divide the top and bottom by \(dt\) and then compute \(d\vec r/dt\) and \(ds/dt\).%
\item\label{task-400} State the unit tangent vector \(\vec T(t)\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
As we progress in this chapter, we'll be computing more derivatives with respect to \(s\), instead of \(t\). Did you notice in the previous exercise that to compute a derivative with respect to \(s\), you just compute the regular derivative with respect to \(t\), and then divide by the speed. Please do the following review exercise to make sure you've got down what \(\frac{d}{ds}\) means.%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-11}
Suppose \(\vec r(t)=(3\cos t,3\sin t,4t)\). Compute \(v\), \(ds/dt\), \(d\vec r/ds\), \(\vec T\), and \(d\vec T/ds\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We have \(\vec v = \dfrac{d\vec r}{dt} = (-3\sin t, 3\cos t, 4)\). The speed is \(\dfrac{ds}{dt}=|\vec v| = \sqrt{9\sin^2t+9\cos^2t+16}=5\). We then compute \(\dfrac{d\vec r}{ds}=\dfrac{d\vec r/dt}{ds/dt} = \dfrac{1}{5}(-3\sin t, 3\cos t, 4)\), which equals \(\vec T\). We finally compute%
\begin{equation*}
\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}=\dfrac{d\vec T/dt}{ds/dt}=\left(\dfrac{1}{ds/dt}\right)\dfrac{d\vec T}{dt} = \left(\dfrac{1}{5}\right)\dfrac{1}{5}(-3\cos t, -3\sin t, 0) =  \dfrac{1}{25}(-3\cos t, -3\sin t, 0).

Imagine that you are at a park with some kids (a nephew, a daughter, etc.). The park has a merry-go-round where the kids can sit down, hold on, and then spin in circles. As the spinning speed increases, they'll feel a greater force trying to throw them outwards. To stay on the merry-go-round, they have to counteract this outward acceleration with their own inward acceleration. For the next few examples, let's examine the connections between \(\vec v\), \(\vec a\), \(\vec T\), \(d\vec T/dt\), \(d\vec T/ds\), and \(|d\vec T/ds|\) in the context of spinning around on a merry-go-round. These few examples are enough to develop just about the entire chapter.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-168}
Sammy sits on a merry go round. He sits 3 feet from the center of the merry ground, and lets his big sister spin him around. We can parameterize Sammy's path with the vector equation \(\vec r(t) = (3\cos t, 3\sin t)\), where \(t\) is in seconds. The point \((0,3)\) corresponds to the time \(t=\pi/2\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-401} Draw the curve for \(0\leq t\leq 2\pi\).%
\item\label{task-402} Compute \(\vec v\) and \(\vec a\).%
\item\label{task-403} At \((0,3)\) (so \(t=\pi/2\)), draw these two vectors. Are these two vectors orthogonal?%
\item\label{task-404} Compute \(\vec T\) and \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{dt}\).%
\item\label{task-405} At \((0,3)\), draw these two vectors. Are these two vectors orthogonal?%
\item\label{task-406} Compute \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\) and \(\left|\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\right|\).%
\item\label{task-407} How is the length of \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\) related to the circle?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-169}
We started with the parameterization \(\vec r(t) = (3\cos t, 3\sin t)\), now we'll replace \(t\) with \(5t\) and \(\omega t\) to understand which values can be used as descriptors of the curve vs. the motion.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-408} Replace \(t\) with \(5t\) and compute \(\vec v\), \(\vec a\), \(\vec T\), \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{dt}\), \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\), and \(\left|\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\right|\).%
\item\label{task-409} If we still want to evaluate at the time corresponding to the point \((0,3)\), what is \(t=\)?.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad It should be smaller than \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)%
\item\label{task-410} Replace \(t\) with \(\omega t\) and find \(\vec v\), \(\vec a\), \(\vec T\), \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{dt}\), \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\), and \(\left|\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\right|\).%
\item\label{task-411} Explain why we should evaluate at \(t=\frac{\pi}{2\omega}\) for the point \((0,3)\).%
\item\label{task-412} Evaluate each at \(t=\frac{\pi}{2\omega}\), the time corresponding to point \((0,3)\).%
\item\label{task-413} At \((0,3)\), which of these 6 quantities remain the same?%
\end{enumerate}

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Curvature}]{Curvature}\label{subsection-43}
We started with motion on a circle with a relatively simple speed. We then multiplied the speed by 5, and then chose a variable speed. You should have noticed that at the same point on the curve, regardless of speed, the quantities \(\vec T\), \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\), and \(\left|\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\right|\) remained the same. Will this pattern continue if we were to change from constant speeds to variable speeds? What if we left the path of a circle, and moved to any smooth curve? How far can we take this pattern? Is it true always? If so, then the quantities \(\vec T\), \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\), and \(\left|\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\right|\) are pretty important quantities that describe the curve we're on.%
\par
Because \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\) and \(\left|\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\right|\) show up a lot, let's give them a definition.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{def_curvature}
Curvature \(\kappa\) and The Curvature Vector \(\vec \kappa\)Let \(\vec r(t)\) be a smooth curve (so that \(\vec v\) is never zero). \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The vector \(\vec \kappa = \dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\) we'll call the curvature vector. It measures how quickly the unit tangent vectors changes as we increase in length (not time).%
\item{}The number \(\kappa = \left|\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\right|\) we'll call the curvature.%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{definition}
Let's apply this new definition to a circle of any radius. We'll quickly see that the curvature and radius of a circle are related. The curvature vector \(d\vec T/ds\) tells us how quickly \(\vec T\) changes as we increase in length, which is a measure of how sharply we turn a corner. If our curve is a circle of radius \(3\), then the curvature is \(1/3\). \emph{A larger circle should result in smaller curvature.}%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-170}
Consider the curve \(\vec r(t)=(a\cos t, a\sin t)\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-414} Draw the curve, and state the radius \(\rho\) of the best approximating circle.%
\item\label{task-415} Find the curvature vector \(\vec \kappa\) by performing a computation.%
\item\label{task-416} What relationship exists between \(\rho\) and \(\kappa\)?  If the radius \(\rho\) were to increase, what would happen to \(\kappa\)?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
For any curve, we could approximate how rapidly the curve turns at a point by drawing a circle that best approximates the curve (kind of like a Taylor polynomial, only now we'll use a circle.) We want the circle to meet the curve \(\vec r\) tangentially, and we want the curvature of the circle to match the curvature of the curve. Since the curvature of the circle must match the curvature of the curve, we know they are inverse related. This gives the following definition.%
\begin{definition}[{Radius of Curvature}]\label{definition-27}
When the curvature \(\kappa\) of a smooth curve is nonzero, we'll define the radius of curvature, written \(\rho\), to be the reciprocal \(\rho = \dfrac{1}{\kappa}\). The curvature and radius of curvature are inversely related.%

Now let's look at what happens if we change the speed in a nonlinear way. For simplicity, let's replace \(t\) with \(t^2\). You could pick any other change. If you aren`t confident with your product rule, then please do the first review exercise. If you need to remember how to show vectors are orthogonal, do the second.%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-12}
Suppose \(f(x) = \sin(x^2)\). Compute \(f'(x)\) and \(f''(x)\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We have \(f'(x) = 2x\cos(x^2)\) and \(f''(x) = -4x^2\sin(x^2)+2\cos(x^2)\).%
\end{project}
\begin{project}[]\label{project-13}
Show that \((-2,3,1)\) and \((4,2,2)\) are orthogonal.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The dot product of these two vectors is \((-2,3,1)\cdot(4,2,2) = -8+6+2=0\). Because the dot product is zero, the vectors are orthogonal.%
\end{project}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-171}
The big kids pushing Sammy on the merry-go-round decide to constantly increase the spinning rate. To parametrize Sammy's path, let's replace \(t\) with \(t^2\) in the original parametrization to obtain \(\vec r(t) = (3\cos t^2, 3\sin t^2)\). Fill in the missing values below, and then answer the questions that follow.%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline
\vec v \amp  ( -6 t \sin \left(t^2\right),6 t \cos \left(t^2\right) ) \\\hline

\kappa =|d\vec T/ds| \amp  \frac{1}{3} \\\hline
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-417} Show that \(\vec v\) and \(\vec a\) are not orthogonal, but that \(\vec T\) and \(d\vec T/dt\) are.%
\item\label{task-418} Because \(\vec r (t)\) includes periodic trig functinos at \((0,3)\) we could have \(t^2 = \frac{\pi}{2}\), \(t^2=2\pi+\frac{\pi}{2}\) or \(t^2=2\pi k + \frac{\pi}{2}\) for any integer \(k\).%
\par
Show that \(\vec T\) is the same at \((0,3)\), regardless of what time we pass through \((0,3)\).%
\item\label{task-419} Show the same is true for \(d\vec T/ds\).%
\item\label{task-420} Let's look at some specific values...%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\roman*),ref=\theenumi.\roman*]
\item\label{task-421} When the speed is \(\frac{ds}{dt}=6\) (so \(t=1\)), how long are \(d\vec T/dt\) and \(d\vec T/ds\)?%
\item\label{task-422} When the speed is \(\frac{ds}{dt}=12\) (so \(t=2\)), how long are \(d\vec T/dt\) and \(d\vec T/ds\)?%
\item\label{task-423} When the speed is \(\frac{ds}{dt}=30\) (so \(t=5\)), how long are \(d\vec T/dt\) and \(d\vec T/ds\)?%
\item\label{task-424} If the speed were some random number \(v\), how long are \(d\vec T/dt\) and \(d\vec T/ds\)?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{observation}[]\label{curvature_observations}
The previous exercise showed the following patterns. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The vectors \(\vec v\) and \(\vec a\) are not always orthogonal.%
\item{}The vectors \(\vec T\) and \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{dt}\) are always orthogonal.%
\item{}The vectors \(\vec T\) and \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\) are independent of speed. They depend only on the shape of the curve, not the speed at which you traverse the curve.%
\item{}If we multiply \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\) by \(\dfrac{ds}{dt}\), we'll get \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{dt}\). The two vectors point in the same direction, which from here on out we'll call \(\vec N\), the direction normal to the motion.%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{observation}
Let's see if this pattern continues when we swap to a different curve. Rather than try to connect the curve to some physical real world example, let's look at a curve we are familiar with, a parabola. If the pattern holds there as well, then we may have found a key pattern that works with all curves. Then we can take our new knowledge and apply it to ANYTHING (like space flight, roller coasters, missiles, and anything that moves).%
\par
If you want to perform the computations below by hand, you must master the product, quotient, and chain rule, as well as working with rational exponents in algebra. Feel free to try the computations by hand (if you can get them, then well done). You may also simply use Sage to do the computations below.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-172}
Consider the curve \(\vec r(t) = (t, t^2)\).

Our \hyperref[curvature_observations]{observation~\ref{curvature_observations}} still holds. It looks like we've found some key facts that pertain to any curve. We only have 3 examples to justify our conclusion, but it's enough to make some definitions and then seek for a concrete proof that holds for every smooth curve.%
\par
Let's prove one of the facts above, namely that \(\vec T\) and its derivative will always be orthogonal. The key here is that \(\vec T\) is a vector of constant length.%
\begin{theorem}[{Vector Valued Functions of Constant Length}]\label{vector_valued_functions_of_constant_length}
If a vector valued function \(\vec r(t)\) has constant length, then the vector \(\vec r\) and its derivative \(\ds\frac{d\vec r}{dt}\) are always orthogonal. Vector valued functions of constant length are orthogonal to their derivative.%
\end{theorem}
\begin{exploration}[Optional Proof of Vector Valued Functions of Constant Length Theorem]\label{exploration-174}
Prove the theorem above. Here are some hints [as an alternative to watching the YouTube video].%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-59}
Watch a \href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08Ygw_M-4yM\&list=PL30EE81142B1ED1F0\&index=6\&feature=plpp_video}{YouTube Video} for the answer.%
\end{aside}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-433} We know that \(\vec r(t)\) has constant length, so we write \(|\vec r|=c\) for some constant \(c\).%
\item\label{task-434} We need to get from a magnitude to a dot product. Look in your text for a way to relate magnitude to the dot product. See \hyperref[dot_product_facts]{Exercise~\ref{dot_product_facts}}.%
\item\label{task-435} After writing \(|\vec r(t)|=c\) in terms of a dot product (squaring both sides may help), take the derivative of both sides. Apply the product rule to the dot product.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
The above fact is so crucial, that we'll repeat what it says.%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-3}{}
If the vector \(\vec v(t)\) has constant length, then the vector and its derivative \(\frac{d\vec v}{dt}\) are orthogonal.%

Let \(\vec r\) be a smooth parametrization of a curve.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-60}

\end{aside}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-436} How long is the \emph{unit} tangent vector \(\vec T(t)\)?%
\item\label{task-437} Explain why \(\vec T\) is orthogonal to \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{dt}\).%
\item\label{task-438} Then give a formula for computing a unit vector that is orthogonal to \(\vec T(t)\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
Based on our answer above, let's make the following definition of the principle unit normal vector. The key idea is that this vector points in the direction of normal acceleration.%
\begin{definition}[{Principle Unit Normal Vector}]\label{definition-28}
Suppose \(\vec r(t)\) is a smooth parametrization of a space curve, where the unit tangent vector is \(\vec T(t)\). We define the principle unit normal vector \(\vec N(t)\) to be the vector%
\begin{equation*}
\vec N(t) = \ds\frac{d\vec T/dt}{|d\vec T/dt|},
\end{equation*}
provided of course that \(|d\vec T/dt|\neq 0\). From \hyperref[T_and_N_are_orthogonal]{Exercise~2} we know that \(\vec T\) and \(\vec N\) are orthogonal.%
\end{definition}
The vector \(\vec N\) is a unit vector in the same direction as the curvature vector. Since \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{dt}\) and \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\) point in the same direction, we could have written \(\vec N = \dfrac{d\vec T/ds}{|d\vec T/ds|} = \dfrac{\vec \kappa}{\kappa}\).%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 8.4.1 The Binormal Vector}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{The Binormal Vector}]{The Binormal Vector}\label{subsection-45}
The vectors \(\vec T\) and \(\vec N\) give us exactly the pieces needed to describe velocity and acceleration. We'll visit this more in a bit. When we are in 3D, these two vectors describe a plane. The binormal vector of the TNB frame is the normal vector to this plane.%
\begin{definition}[{Binormal Vector}]\label{definition-29}
If \(\vec r\) is a parametrization of a smooth space curve with unit tangent vector \(\vec T\) and principle unit normal vector \(\vec N\), then we define the binormal vector \(\vec B\) to be the cross product%
\begin{equation*}
\vec B = \vec T\times \vec N.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
It's normal to both \(\vec T\) and \(\vec N\), hence called the \terminology{bi}normal vector.%
\end{definition}
We now have the entire \(TNB\) frame. This gives us a moving collection of unit vectors that act like an \(xyz\) coordinate system. Many of you will use this frame a ton in your dynamics course. The TNB frame shows up in physical chemistry as well. A key fact to remember is that all three vectors are unit vectors, and they are each orthogonal to the other.%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-14}
Find the area of a parallelogram with corners \((0,0,0)\), \((1,0,2)\), and \((1,1,3)\), and \((2,1,5)\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad We find area of a parallelogram by the vectors that form the edges. Since one point is the origin (subtracting it from the 2nd and 3rd points won't change anything), we compute the cross product \((1,0,2)\times 
(1,1,3) 
= (-2,-1,1)\). The magnitude of the cross product is the area \(A = \sqrt{4+1+1}=\sqrt{6}\).%
\end{project}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-176}
Answer the following questions (this will review your knowledge of the dot and cross products).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-439} What is \(\vec T\cdot \vec N\)? Explain.%
\item\label{task-440} Now explain why \(\vec T\cdot \vec B=0\) and \(\vec N\cdot \vec B=0\).%
\item\label{task-441} Both \(\vec T\) and \(\vec N\) are unit vectors. They are also orthogonal. Why is \(\vec B\) is a unit vector? [What's the connection between the cross product and area.]%
\item\label{task-442} We defined \(\vec B=\vec T\times \vec N\). This means that \(\vec N\times \vec T=-\vec B\).  Do we have \(\vec T\times \vec B\) equal to \(\vec N\) or \(-\vec N\)? Explain.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad What does the right hand rule say? Compare to \(\hat i\times \hat k\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
Let's carry through a single exercise where we compute \(\vec T\), \(\vec N\), and \(\vec B\).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{helix_example_of_T_N_and_B}
Consider the helix \(\vec r(t) = (3\cos t,3\sin t, 4t)\). Find the unit tangent vector \(\vec T(t)\), principle unit normal vector \(\vec N(t)\), and the binormal vector \(\vec B(t)\).%

You've now developed the TNB frame for describing motion. Engineers will see this again when they study dynamics. Mathematicians who study differential geometry will use these ideas as well.

When a civil engineering team builds a road, they have to pay attention to the curvature of the road. If the curvature of the road is too large, accidents will happen and the civil engineering team will be liable. How do they make sure the curvature never gets to large? They use the circle of curvature. When they want to cause a road to turn, they'll find the center of curvature, send a surveyor out to the center, and then have the surveyor make sure that the road follows the circle of curvature for a short distance. They actually pace out the circle of curvature and then build the road along this circle for a hundred feet or so. Then, they recompute the radius of curvature (if they need the direction to change again), and pace out another circle. In this way, they can guarantee that the curvature never gets large. In the next section we'll see how curvature is directly related to normal acceleration (which is what causes semis to tip, and vehicles to slide off icy roads.)%

The unit tangent vector \(\vec T\) provides us with a unit vector in the direction of motion. We can obtain the direction of motion from the velocity. If we stay on a straight course, then our acceleration is in the same direction as our motion, and would only cause us to speed up or slow down. We'll call this tangential acceleration.%
\par
If we want to design a roller coaster, build an F15 fighter plane, send a satellite in orbit, or construct anything that doesn't move in a straight line, we need to understand how acceleration causes us to leave a straight path. We may still be speeding up or slowing down (tangential acceleration), but now we'll have a component that veers us off the straight path. We'll call this normal acceleration, it's orthogonal to the velocity.%
\par
Back in the vector chapter, we practiced writing a force \(\vec F\) as the sum of the component parallel to a displacement \(\vec d\) and the component orthogonal to \(\vec d\). We could write this as \(\vec F = \vec F_{|| \text{ to } \vec d} + \vec F_{\perp \text{ to } \vec d}.\) The parallel part came from a projection. The orthogonal part came from vector subtraction. If you've forgotten how to do this, please do this review exercise.%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-16}
Consider the force vector \(\vec F = (0,-10)\), and displacement vector \(\vec (2,-1)\). Compute the projection of \(\vec F\) onto \(\vec d\), and then write \(\vec F\) as the sum of a vector parallel to \(\vec d\) and a vector orthogonal to \(\vec d\).%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-62}
This is a good time to look back over the projection section from Unit 1: \hyperref[prob_force_intro]{Exercise~\ref{prob_force_intro}}%
\end{aside}
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The projection is \(\proj_{\vec d}\vec F = \frac{10}{5}(2,-1) = (4,-2)\).  This is the parallel component \(\vec F_{|| \text{ to } \vec d} =(4,-2)\).  To get the orthogonal component, we know that \(\vec F = \vec F_{|| \text{ to } \vec d} + \vec F_{\perp \text{ to } \vec d}\). Vector subtraction gives \(\vec F_{\perp \text{ to } \vec d} = \vec F -\vec F_{|| \text{ to } \vec d} = (0,-10)-(4,-2) = (-4,-8)\). We now write%
\begin{equation*}
\vec F = (4,-2) + (-4,-8).\text{.}

If we throw a pebble from a 64 ft tall cliff, then we could parameterize the path after \(t\) seconds using \(\vec r(t) = (3t,64-16t^2)\). The numbers below get rather large in a hurry, so let's use a simpler parameterization to gain understanding about the connection between \(\vec v\), \(\vec a\), \(\vec T\), and \(\vec N\). Sometimes the key to understanding is to simplify the exercise.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-179}
Consider the parameterization \(\vec r(t) = (t,9-t^2)\) (it's a simplified version of tossing a pebble off a building). Our goal, at time \(t=1\), is to write \(\vec a\) in the form \(\vec a = a_T\vec T+a_N\vec N.\) Follow the steps below.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-447} Compute \(\vec v\), \(\vec a\), and \(\vec T\) at time \(t\), and then at time \(t=1\).%
\item\label{task-448} At \(t=1\), compute the projection of \(\vec a\) onto \(\vec T\), i.e. compute \(\proj_{\vec T(1)}\vec a(1)\).%
\item\label{task-449} State \(\vec N(t)\) (remember you can flip the order and change a sign), and then at \(t=1\) compute \(\text{ proj } _{\vec N(1)}\vec a(1)\).%
\item\label{task-450} If we write \(\vec a = a_T\vec T +a_N\vec N\), then what are \(a_T\) and \(a_N\)?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{definition}[{Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration}]\label{definition-30}
Suppose that \(\vec r(t)\) is a smooth parametrization of a moving object. Let \(\vec T\) be the unit tangent vector. The tangential component of acceleration and the normal component of acceleration are the scalars \(a_T\) and \(a_N\) that we obtain by writing the acceleration as the sum of a vector parallel to \(T\) and a vector orthogonal to \(\vec T\), i.e. the scalars that satisfy%
\begin{equation*}
\vec a = a_T\vec T+a_N\vec N.

Let's return to the example of Sammy on a merry-go-round. From this example, we'll see one of the key ideas in this section.%
\begin{exploration}[Optional]\label{exploration-180}
Suppose that Sammy sits \(\rho\) feet away from the center of the merry-go-ground. His sister decides to spin him around at different speeds. Let \(\vec r(t) = (\rho \cos \omega t, \rho \sin \omega t)\) be a parametrization of Sammy's postion.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-451} Show that Sammy's speed is \(|\vec v|=\rho \omega\).%
\item\label{task-452} Find the curvature of Sammy's path at any time \(t\) (it happens to be constant - and we did this already when we computed the curvature along a circle).%
\item\label{task-453} Find the acceleration vector, and show that \(\ds |\vec a| = \kappa |\vec v|^2 = \frac{|\vec v|^2}{\rho}\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
In the exercise above, all of the acceleration is in the normal direction. The interesting thing to note is that the normal acceleration is ALWAY \(a_N =  \frac{|\vec v|^2}{\rho}=\kappa |\vec v|^2\). That's what we'll now show. We'll show that the acceleration of an object moving along a curve \(\vec r(t)\) with velocity \(\vec v(t)\) is the sum%
\begin{equation*}
\vec a(t) = a_T\vec T+a_N\vec N=\frac{d}{dt}|\vec v(t)| \vec T + \kappa |\vec v|^2 \vec N.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The scalars \(a_T=\dfrac{d}{dt}|\vec v(t)|\) and \(a_N=\kappa |\vec v|^2\) are the tangential and normal components of acceleration. All we have to do is write the vector \(\vec a(t)\) as the sum of a vector parallel to \(\vec T\) and a vector orthogonal to \(\vec T\).%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-63}
Engineers often use the equivalent formula \(a_N = \frac{|\vec v|^2}{\rho}\), as \(\rho\) is a physical distance that they can measure.%
\end{aside}
Before we decompose the acceleration into its tangential and normal components, let's look at two examples to see what these facts physically represent.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-181}
Imagine that you are riding as a passenger on a road and encounter a series of switchbacks (so the road starts to zigzag up the mountain). Right before each bend in the road, you see a yellow sign that tells you a U-turn is coming up, and that you should reduce your speed from 45 mi/hr to 15 mi/hr. Assume the largest curvature along the turn is \(\kappa\). Recall that \(a_N=\kappa |\vec v|^2\). The engineers of the road designed the road so that if you are moving at 15 mi/hr, then the normal acceleration will be at most \(A\) units.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-454} Suppose that your driver (Ben) ignores the suggestion to slow down to 15 mi/hr.  He keeps going 45 mi/hr through the turn. Had he slowed down, the max acceleration would be \(A\).  You're traveling 3 times faster than suggested.  What will your maximum normal acceleration be?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad It's more than \(3A\).%
\item\label{task-455} You yell at Ben to slow down (you don't want to die). So Ben decides to only slow to 30 mi/hr. He figures this means you'll only feel twice as much acceleration as \(A\).  Explain why this line of reasoning is flawed.%
\item\label{task-456} Ben gets frustrated by the fact that he has to slow down. He complains about the engineers who designed the road, and says, ``they should have just built a larger corner so I could keep going 45.''  How much larger should the radius of the circle be so that you can travel 45 mi/hr instead of 15 mi/hr, and still feel the same acceleration \(A\)?%
\item\label{task-457} Which will cause the normal acceleration to decrease more, halving your speed or halving the curvature (doubling the radius)?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-182}
Prove that \(\ds \vec a(t) = a_T\vec T+a_N\vec N=\frac{d}{dt}|\vec v| \vec T + \kappa |\vec v|^2 \vec N.\) Here's some hints.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-64}
Watch a \href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSh2Bdd-yTg\&feature=bf_next\&list=PL30EE81142B1ED1F0\&lf=plpp_video}{YouTube Video}.%
\end{aside}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-458} Rewrite the velocity \(\vec v\) as a magnitude \(|\vec v|\) times a direction \(\vec T\), so \(\vec v = |v|\vec T\).%
\item\label{task-459} We know that \(\vec a(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\vec v(t)\). Take the derivative of \(\vec v = |\vec v|\vec T\) by using the product rule (on the scalar product \(|\vec v|\vec T\)).%
\item\label{task-460} You should encounter the quantity \(d\vec T/dt\). We know that \(\frac{d\vec T}{dt} = |\vec v|\frac{d\vec T}{ds}\). Why does \(\ds d\vec T/dt=|\vec v|\kappa\vec N\)?%
\item\label{task-461} Conclude to explain why \(a_N =\kappa |\vec v|^2\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
Let's now use the fact above to get an extremely useful formula for the curvature.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-183}
Show that%
\begin{equation*}
\kappa = \frac{|\vec v\times \vec a|}{|\vec v|^3} = \frac{|\vec r'\times \vec r''|}{|\vec r'|^3}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad We know that \(\ds \vec a = a_T\vec T+a_N\vec N=\frac{d}{dt}|\vec v| \vec T + \kappa |\vec v|^2 \vec N.\) Cross both sides with \(\vec v\). You should be able to cancel \(\vec v\times \vec v\) (why). Then take the magnitude of each side and solve for \(\kappa\). You'll have to explain why \(|\vec v\times \vec N| = |\vec v|\).%
\end{exploration}
We can use the above formula for curvature to get a quick way to compute the curvature of a function \(y=f(x)\). If you use the previous exercise, this formula falls out almost instantly. You'd see this formula in dynamics. This is the culminating idea from this chapter that you'll use again and again in engineering courses.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-65}
And it shows up on the Fundamentals of Engineering exam (where you just have to use the formula, not prove where it comes from)!%
\end{aside}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{formula_for_curvature}
The function \(y=f(x)\) can be given the parametrization \(\vec r(x) = (x,f(x))\). Use this parametrization (and the previous exercise) to show that the curvature is%
\begin{equation*}
\kappa(x) = \frac{|f''(x)|}{(1+(f')^2)^{3/2}},
\end{equation*}
and that the radius of curvature is%
\begin{equation*}
\rho(x) = \frac{(1+(f')^2)^{3/2}}{|f''(x)|}.
\end{equation*}

We will be skipping this section, however, if you want to see more tie-in to physics and engineering, this skim this section.%
\end{aside}
\begin{definition}[{Torsion}]\label{definition-31}
Let \(\vec r(t)\) be a parametrization of a smooth curve \(C\) with unit tangent vector \(\vec T(t)\). The derivative of \(\vec B\) with respect to \(s\) tells us how rapidly the plane containing \(\vec T\) and \(\vec N\) rotates. We'll define the torsion vector to be%
\begin{equation*}
\vec \tau = \dfrac{d\vec B}{ds} = \dfrac{d\vec B/dt}{ds/dt}=\dfrac{d\vec B/dt}{|d\vec r/dt|}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The torsion \(\tau\), up to a sign, is the length of this vector. We say there is positive torsion if \(\vec \tau\) causes a counterclockwise rotation about \(\vec T\) (as you look down \(\vec T\)), which occurs precisely when \(\vec tau\) and \(\vec N\) point in opposite directions. We can summarize this is%
\begin{equation*}
\tau=\left|\dfrac{d\vec B}{ds}\right| \text{ or }  \tau=-\left|\dfrac{d\vec B}{ds}\right|,
\end{equation*}
where you choose ``\(+\)'' if \(\vec N\) and \(\vec \tau\) point in opposite directions.%

\end{definition}
The computations involved in getting \(\tau\) require a lot of work. Let's use the computer to help us. You can do all of this with the aid of Sage. I'll let you decide from the code what \(\tau\) is. That will be your decision to make.%
\begin{exploration}[Optional]\label{exploration-185}
Consider the helix \(r(t)=(3\cos t, 3\sin t, 4t)\). In \hyperref[helix_example_of_T_N_and_B]{Exercise~\ref{helix_example_of_T_N_and_B}} we found%
\begin{align*}
\vec T \amp = (-\frac{3}{5}\sin t,\frac{3}{5}\cos t,\frac{4}{5})\\
\vec N \amp = (-\cos t,-\sin t,0)\\
\vec B \amp = (\frac{4}{5}\sin t,-\frac{4}{5}\cos t,\frac{3}{5})
\end{align*}
%
\par
Compute the torsion vector \(\vec \tau=\dfrac{d\vec B}{ds}\), and then give the torsion \(\tau\) (you'll need to determine the speed). Is the torsion positive or negative. Ask me in class to show you how you would be able to determine this physically (without any computations).%

In the examples above, you should have noticed that \(\vec \tau\) was either parallel to \(\vec N\) or anti-parallel to \(\vec N\). Let's now show this is always the case. The key is to use the product rule on the cross product, together with some key fact about the cross product.%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-17}
What is the cross product of \((1,2,3)\) and \((2,4,6)\)? If two vectors are parallel, then what is their cross product? In particular, what is the cross product of \(\vec N\) and \(\vec \kappa\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The cross product of parallel vectors is always the zero vector \((0,0,0)\). This is because the area of the parallelogram formed using the parallel vectors is always zero. So all three answers are \((0,0,0)\).%

\end{itemize}

Now that we can describe motion, let's turn our attention to the work done by a vector field as we move through the field. Work is a transfer of energy. Here are a few examples: \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}A tornado picks up a couch, and applies forces to the couch as the couch swirls around the center. Work transfers the energy from the tornado to the couch, giving the couch it's kinetic energy.%
\item{}When an object falls gravity does work on the object. The work done by gravity converts potential energy to kinetic energy.%
\item{}If we consider the flow of water down a river, it's gravity that gives the water its kinetic energy. We can place a hydro electric dam next to river to capture a lot of this kinetic energy.  Work transfers the kinetic energy of the river to rotational energy of the turbine, which eventually ends up as electrical energy available in our homes.%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
When we study work, we are really studying how energy is transferred. This is one of the key components of modern life.%
\par
Let's start with simple review. Recall that the work done by a vector field \(\vec F\) through a displacement \(\vec d\) is the dot product \(\vec F\cdot \vec d\). We saw this in \hyperref[first_work_problem]{Exercise~\ref{first_work_problem}}.%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-18}
An object moves from \(A=(6,0)\) to \(B=(0,3)\). Along the way, it encounters the constant force \(\vec F = (2,5)\). How much work is done by \(\vec F\) as the object moves from \(A\) to \(B\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad The displacement is \(B-A=(-6,3)\). The work is \(\vec F\cdot \vec d = (2,5)\cdot(-6,3) = -12+15=3\).%
\end{project}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-188}
An object moves from \(A=(6,0)\) to \(B=(0,3)\). A parametrization of the object's path is \(\vec r(t) = (-6,3)t+(6,0)\) for \(0\leq t\leq 1\). We are going to investigate what happens under a non-constant force.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-465} For \(0\leq t\leq .5\), what is the displacement vector \(\vec{d}\) from \(\vec{r}(0) \rightarrow \vec{r}(0.5)\)? If the force encountered over this section is \(\vec F = (2,5)\) how much work is done?%
\item\label{task-466} For \(.5\leq t\leq 1\), what is the displacement vector \(\vec{d}\) from \(\vec{r}(0.5) \rightarrow \vec{r}(1)\)? If the force encountered over this section is \(\vec F = (2,6)\) how much work is done?%
\item\label{task-467} How much total work was done?%
\item\label{task-468} Suppose that the force constantly changes as we move along the curve. At \(t\), we'll assume we encountered the force \(F(t) = (2,5+2t)\).%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-70}
You can visualize what's happening in this exercise as follows.  Attach a clothesline between the points (maybe representing two trees in your backyard).  Put a cub scout space derby ship on the clothesline.  Then the wind starts to blow.  As the ship moves along the clothesline, the wind changes direction.%
\end{aside}

\item\label{task-469} Find \(\ds W=\int \vec F\cdot d\vec r = \int_0^{0.5} (2,5+2t)\cdot (-6,3)dt.\) How does this compare to part (1)?%
\item\label{task-470} Find \(\ds W=\int \vec F\cdot d\vec r = \int_0^1 (2,5+2t)\cdot (-6,3)dt.\) How does this compare to part (3)?%
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{task-471} Explain why the total work done by this force along the path is \(\ds W=\int \vec F\cdot d\vec r\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad What does \(\vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r}\) represent?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
We know how to compute work when we move along a straight line. Prior to \hyperref[first_work_problem]{Exercise~\ref{first_work_problem}} on \hyperref[first_work_problem]{page~\ref{first_work_problem}}, we made the following statements.%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-4}{}
If a force \(F\) acts through a displacement \(d\), then the most basic definition of work is \(W=Fd\), the product of the force and the displacement.  This basic definition has a few assumptions. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The force \(F\) must act in the same direction as the displacement.%
\item{}The force \(F\) must be constant throughout the  displacement.%
\item{}The displacement must be in a straight line.%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{quote}
We used the dot product to remove the first assumption, and we showed in \hyperref[first_work_problem]{Exercise~\ref{first_work_problem}} that the work is simply the dot product%
\begin{equation*}
W=\vec F\cdot \vec r,
\end{equation*}
where \(\vec F\) is a force acting through a displacement \(\vec r\). The previous exercise showed that we can remove the assumption that \(\vec F\) is constant, by integrating to obtain%
\begin{equation*}
W=\int \vec F \cdot d\vec r = \int_a^b F\cdot \frac{d\vec r}{dt}dt,
\end{equation*}
provided we have a parametrization of \(\vec r\) with \(a\leq t\leq b\). The next exercise gets rid of the assumption that \(\vec r\) is a straight line.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-189}
Suppose that we move along the circle \(\vec r(t) = (3\cos t,3\sin t)\). As we move along this circle, we encounter a rotation force \(\vec F(x,y) = (-2y,2x)\).%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-71}
\href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TGZIIpEaHw\&list=PL04DF68E73B7ECD54\&index=2\&feature=plpp_video}{Watch a YouTube video} about work.%
\end{aside}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-472} Draw the curve \(\vec r(t)\). Then at several points on the curve, draw the vector field \(\vec F(x,y)\).  For example, at the point \((3,0)\) you should have the vector \(\vec F(3,0)=(-2(0),2(3))=(0,6)\), a vector sticking straight up 6 units. Are we moving with the vector field, or against the vector field?%
\item\label{task-473} Explain why we can state that a little bit of work done over a small displacement is \(dW = \vec F\cdot d\vec r\). Why does it not matter that \(\vec r\) moves in a straight line?%
\item\label{task-474} \begin{aside}{}\label{aside-72}
We put the \(C\) under the integral \(\int_C\) to remind us that we are integrating along the curve \(C\).  This means we need to get a parametrization of the curve \(C\), and give bounds before we can integrate with respect to \(t\).%
\end{aside}
Explain why the work done by \(\vec F\) along the circle \(C\)  is%
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_C\left(-2y,2x\right)\cdot d\vec r
= \int_0^{2\pi}\left(-2(3\sin t),2(3\cos t)\right)\cdot(-3\sin t, 3\cos t)dt.
\end{equation*}
Then integrate to show that the work done by \(\vec F\) along this circle is \(36\pi\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
It's time for a definition.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-32}
The work done by a vector field \(\vec F\), along a curve \(C\) with parametrization \(\vec r(t)\) for \(a\leq t\leq b\) is%
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r= \int_a^b \vec F\cdot \frac{d\vec r}{dt}dt.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
If we let \(\vec F = (M,N)\) and we let \(\vec r(t)=(x,y)\), so that \(d\vec r = (dx,dy)\), then we can write work in the differential form%
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r= \int_C (M,N)\cdot (dx,dy) = \int_C Mdx+Ndy.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{definition}
\begin{project}[]\label{project-19}
Consider the curve \(y=3x^2-5x\) for \(-2\leq x\leq 1\). Give a parametrization of this curve.%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Solution.}\quad Whenever you have a function of the form \(y=f(x)\), you can always use \(x=t\) and \(y=f(t)\) to parametrize the curve.  So we can use \(\vec r(t) = (t, 3t^2-5t)\) for \(-2\leq t\leq 1\) as a parametrization.%

The examples above showed us that we can compute work along any closed curve. All we have to do is parametrize the curve, take a derivative, and then compute \(dW = \vec F \cdot d\vec r\).

In the exercises for the previous sections, the vector fields represented forces. However, vector fields can represent much more than just forces. The vector field might represent the flow of water down a river, or the flow of air across an airplane wing. When we think of the vector field as a velocity field, then we mights ask the question, how much of the fluid flows along our curve. Alternately, we might ask how much of the fluid flows across our curve. These two exercises lead to flow along a curve, and flux across a curve. Flow along a curve is directly related to the lift of an airplane wing (which occurs when the flow along the top of the wing is different than the flow below the wing). The flux across a curve will quickly take us to powering a wind mill as wind flows across the surface of a blade (once we hit 3D integrals).%

In first semester calculus, we learned that the area under a function \(f(x)\) above the \(x\)-axis is given by \(A = \int_a^b f(x) dx\). The quantity \(dA= f(x) dx\) represents a small bit of area whose length is \(dx\) and whose height is \(f(x)\). To get the total area, we just added up the little bits of area, which is why%
\begin{equation*}
A=\int dA = \int_a^b f(x) dx.

Think of this region as a metal plate that has been stood up with its base on \(C\) where the height above each spot is given by \(z=f(x,y)\).%

\begin{equation*}
\int_C f ds

Work, flow, circulation, and flux are all examples of line integrals. Remember that work, flow, and circulation are%
\begin{equation*}
W=\int_C (\vec F\cdot \vec T)ds =\int_C (M,N)\cdot(dx,dy) =  \int_C Mdx+Ndy,
\end{equation*}
while the formula for flux is%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi=\int_C (\vec F\cdot \vec n)ds =\int_C (M,N)\cdot(dy,-dx) =  \int_C Mdy-Ndx.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Do you see how these are both the line integral of a function \(f = \vec F\cdot \vec T\) or \(f=\vec F\cdot \vec n\) along a curve \(C\). The function \(f\) inside the integrand does not have to represent the height of a sheet. We'll use it to represent lots of things. Let's practice two more work/flux exercises, to sharpen our skills with these concepts.%

Similarly, guess the sign of the flux along each edge.  Explain.%

\par \par {\bf Solution: }\par  SOLUTION \par 

We can work out the relative sizes of the line integrals by seeing
which curves move in the same direction of the vectors, which move
in the opposite direction, and which move perpendicular.  In the first
case, the integral will be positive, in the second, negative, and in
the third, zero.  Thus, we see that
\(\int_{C_1}\vec F\cdot d\vec r > 0\), because the curve moves from left to right, in the same direction as the vector field.

\par 
By similar logic, we note that both of \(\int_{C1}\vec F\cdot d\vec r\) and \(\int_{C2}\vec F\cdot d\vec r\) are positive.  However, because \(C_1\) has a smaller component pointing in the same direction as the vector field, the integral on \(C_1\) is larger than that on \(C_2\).\par 

Applying this logic to each of the curves, we find that
\[\int_{C_{3}}\vec F\cdot\vec r <
   \int_{C_{2}}\vec F\cdot\vec r <
   \int_{C_{1}}\vec F\cdot\vec r.\]

In this section we'll return to the concept of work. Many vector fields are actually the derivative of a function. When this occurs, computing work along a curve is extremely easy. All you have to know is the endpoints of the curve, and the function \(f\) whose derivative gives you the vector field. This function is called a potential for a vector field. Once we are comfortable finding potentials, we'll show that the work done by such a vector field is the difference in the potential at the end points. This makes finding work extremely fast.%
\begin{definition}[{Gradients and Potentials}]\label{definition-35}
Let \(\vec F\) be a vector field. A potential for the vector field is a function \(f\) whose derivative equals \(\vec F\). So if \(Df=\vec F\), then we say that \(f\) is a potential for \(\vec F\). When we want to emphasize that the derivative of \(f\) is a vector field, we call \(Df\) the gradient of \(f\) and write \(Df = \vec \nabla f\). If \(\vec F\) has a potential, then we say that \(\vec F\) is a gradient field.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-95}
The symbol \(\vec \nabla f\) is read ``the gradient of \(f\)'' or ``del f.''%

\end{definition}
We'll quickly see that if a vector field has a potential, then the work done by the vector field is the difference in the potential. If you've ever dealt with kinetic and potential energy, then you hopefully recall that the change in kinetic energy is precisely the difference in potential energy. This is the reason we use the word ``potential.''%

\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{thm_has_potential}
Let \(\vec F\) be a vector field that is everywhere continuously differentiable. Then \(\vec F\) has a potential if and only if the derivative \(D\vec F\) is a symmetric matrix. We say that a matrix is symmetric if interchanging the rows and columns results in the same matrix (so if you replace row 1 with column 1, and row 2 with column 2, etc., then you obtain the same matrix).%

If a vector field has a potential, then there is an extremely simple way to compute work. To see this, we must first review the fundamental theorem of calculus. The second half of the fundamental theorem of calculus states,%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-5}{}
If \(f\) is continuous on \([a,b]\) and \(F\) is an anti-derivative of \(f\), then \(F(b)-F(a) = \int_a^b f(x) dx\).%
\end{quote}
If we replace \(f\) with \(f'\), then an anti-derivative of \(f'\) is \(f\), and we can write,%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-6}{}
If \(f\) is continuously differentiable on \([a,b]\), then%
\begin{equation*}
f(b)-f(a)=\int_a^b f'(x) dx.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{quote}
This last version is the version we now generalize.%

\begin{theorem}[{The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals}]\label{theorem-6}
Suppose \(f\) is a continuously differentiable function, defined along some open region containing the smooth curve \(C\). Let \(\vec r(t)\) be a parametrization of the curve \(C\) for \(t\in[a,b]\). Then we have%
\begin{equation*}
f(\vec r(b))-f(\vec r(a))=\int_a^b Df(\vec r(t))D\vec r(t)\ dt.

\end{aside}
\end{theorem}
Notice that if \(\vec F\) is a vector field, and has a potential \(f\), which means \(\vec F = Df\), then we could rephrase this theorem as follows.%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-7}{}
Suppose \(\vec F\) is a a vector field that is continuous along some open region containing the curve \(C\). Suppose \(\vec F\) has a potential \(f\). Let \(A\) and \(B\) be the start and end points of the smooth curve \(C\).  Then the work done by \(\vec F\) along \(C\) depends only on the start and end points, and is precisely%
\begin{equation*}
f(B)-f(A)=\int_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r = \int_C Mdx+Ndy.
\end{equation*}
The work done by \(\vec F\) is the difference in a potential.%
\end{quote}
If you are familiar with kinetic energy, then you should notice a key idea here. Work is a transfer of energy. As an object falls, energy is transferred from potential energy to kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy at the end of a fall is precisely equal to the difference between the potential energy at the top of the fall and the potential energy at the bottom of the fall (neglecting air resistance). So work (the transfer of energy) is exactly the difference in potential energy.%
\begin{exploration}[Optional: Proof of the Fundamental Theorem]\label{exploration-204}

\section[{Applications: Average Value}]{Applications: Average Value}\label{ch09_04_average}
In the final two sections, we will examine several additional applications of line-integrals. The first is finding average values. The concept of averaging values together has many applications. In first-semester calculus, we saw how to generalize the concept of averaging numbers together to get an average value of a function. We'll review both of these concepts. In the next section we'll generalize average value to calculate centroids and center of mass.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{average_value_methods}
Suppose a class takes a test and there are three scores of 70, five scores of 85, one score of 90, and two scores of 95. We will calculate the average class score, \(\bar s\), four different ways to emphasize four ways of thinking about the averages. We are emphasizing the pattern of the calculations in this exercise, rather than the final answer, so it is important to write out each calculation completely in the form \(\bar s = \blank{1cm}\) before calculating the number \(\bar s\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-541} Compute the average by adding 11 numbers together and dividing by the number of scores.  Write down the whole computation before doing any arithmetic.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-107}
\(\bar s=\frac{\sum \text{ values } }{\text{ number of values } }\)%
\end{aside}
\item\label{task-542} Compute the numerator of the fraction in the previous part by multiplying each score by how many times it occurs, rather than adding it in the sum that many times.  Again, write down the calculation for \(\bar s\) before doing any arithmetic.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-108}
\(\bar s=\frac{\sum (\text{ value } \cdot\text{ weight } )}{\sum \text{ weight } }\)}%
\end{aside}
\item\label{task-543} Compute \(\bar s\) by splitting up the fraction in the previous part into the sum of four numbers.  This is called a ``weighted average'' because we are multiplying each score value by a weight.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-109}
\(\bar s=\sum (\text{ value } \cdot\text{ (\% of stuff) } )=\sum (\text{ value }  \cdot \frac{\text{ weight } }{\text{ \# of values } } )\)}%
\end{aside}
\item\label{task-544} Another way of thinking about the average \(\bar s\) is that \(\bar s\) is the number so that if all 11 scores were the same value \(\bar s\), you'd have the same sum of scores.  Write this way of thinking about these computations by taking the formulas for \(\bar s\) in the first two parts and multiplying both sides by the denominator.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-110}
\(\text{ (number of values) } \bar s = \sum \text{ values }\) \((\sum \text{ weight } )\bar s = \sum (\text{ value } \cdot\text{ weight } )\)}%
\end{aside}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
In the next exercise, we generalize the above ways of thinking about averages from a discrete situation to a continuous situation. You did this in first-semester calculus if you found average values using integrals.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-211}
Suppose the price of a stock is \textdollar{}10 for one day. Then the price of the stock jumps to \textdollar{}20 for two days. Our goal is to determine the average price of the stock over the three days.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-545} Why is the average stock price not \textdollar{}15?%
\item\label{task-546} Let \(f(t) = \begin{cases}10 \amp 0\lt t\lt 1\\20\amp 1\lt t\lt 3
\end{cases}\), the price of the stock for the three-day period. Draw the function \(f\), and find the area under \(f\) where \(t\in[0,3]\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad You can do this without integrals%
\item\label{task-547} Now let \(y=\bar f\).  The area under \(\bar f\) over \([0,3]\) is simply width times height, or \((b-a)\bar f\). What should \(\bar f\) equal so that the area under \(\bar f\) over \([0,3]\) matches the area under \(f\) over \([0,3]\).%
\item\label{task-548} We found a constant \(\bar f\) so that the area under \(\bar f\) matched the area under \(f\). In other words, we solved the equation below for \(\bar f\):%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b \bar f dx = \int_a^b f dx
\end{equation*}
Solve for \(\bar f\) symbolically (without doing any of the integrals). This quantity is called the average value of \(f\) over \([a,b]\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad Remember \(\bar{f}\) is a constant%
\item\label{task-549} The formula for \(\bar f\) in the previous part resembles at least one of the ways of calculating averages from \hyperref[average_value_methods]{Exercise~1}.  Which ones and why?%
\end{enumerate}

What's the maximum height and minimum height of the sheet?%
\item\label{task-554} We'd like to find a constant height \(\bar f\) so that the area under \(f\), above \(C\), is the same as area under \(\bar f\), above \(C\). This height \(\bar f\) is called the average value of \(f\) along \(C\).%

\end{aside}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\roman*),ref=\theenumi.\roman*]

\begin{equation*}
\bar f = \frac{\int_C f ds}{\int_C ds}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad The area under \(\bar f\) above \(C\) is \(\int_C \bar f ds\). The area under \(f\) above \(C\) is \(\int_C f ds\). Set them equal and solve for \(\bar f\).%
\item\label{task-556} Connect this formula with the ways of thinking about averages from \hyperref[average_value_methods]{Exercise~1}.%

Use a computer to evaluate the integrals \(\int_C f ds\) and \(\int_C ds\), and then give an approximation to the average value of \(f\) along \(C\). Is your average value between the maximum and minimum of \(f\) along \(C\)? Why should it be?%

\begin{definition}[{Centroid}]\label{definition-37}
Let \(C\) be a curve. If we look at all of the \(x\)-coordinates of the points on \(C\), the ``center'' \(x\)-coordinate, \(\bar x\), is the average of all these \(x\)-coordinates. Likewise, we can talk about the averages of all of the \(y\) coordinates or \(z\) coordinates of points on the function (\(\bar y\) or \(\bar z\), respectively). The \terminology{centroid} of an object is the geometric center \((\bar x, \bar y, \bar z)\), the point with coordinates that are the average \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) coordinates.%
\end{definition}

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Mass}]{Mass}\label{subsection-55}
Density is generally a mass per unit volume. However, when talking about a curve or wire, as in this chapter, it's simpler to let density be the mass per unit length. Sometimes an object is made out of a composite material, and the density of the object is different at different places in the object. For example, we might have a straight wire where one end is steel and the other end is nickel. In the middle, the wire slowly transitions from being all steel to all nickel. The centroid is the midpoint of the wire. However, since nickel has a higher density than steel, the balance point (the center of mass) would not be at the midpoint of the wire, but would be closer to the denser and heavier nickel end. In this sub-section, we'll develop formulas for the mass and in the next sub-section formulas for the center of mass of such a wire. Such composite materials are engineered all the time (though probably not our example wire).%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-116}
In future mechanical engineering courses, you would learn how to determine the density \(\delta\) (mass per unit length) at each point on such a composite wire.%

Suppose a wire \(C\) has the parameterization \(\vec r(t)\) for \(t\in[a,b]\). Suppose the wire's density at a point \((x,y,z)\) on the wire is given by the function \(\delta(x,y,z)\).%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-117}

\typeout{Subsection 9.5.3 Center of Mass}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Center of Mass}]{Center of Mass}\label{subsection-56}
The center of mass of an object is the point where the object balances. In order to calculate the \(x\)-coordinate of the center of mass, we average the \(x\)-coordinates, but we weight each \(x\)-coordinate with its mass. Similarly, we can calculate the \(y\) and \(z\) coordinates of the center of mass.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-119}
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass}{Wikipedia} has some interesting applications of center of mass.%
\end{aside}
The next exercise helps us reason about the center of mass of a collection of objects. Calculating the center of mass of a collection of objects is important, for example, in astronomy when you want to calculate how two bodies orbit each other.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{center_of_mass_with_two_points}
Suppose two objects are positioned at the points \(P_1=(x_1,y_1,z_1)\) and \(P_2=(x_2,y_2,z_2)\). Our goal in this exercise is to understand the difference between the centroid and the center of mass.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

\item\label{task-573} Give a physical reason for your answer before doing any computations.%
\item\label{task-574} Now find the center of mass \((\bar x, \bar y, \bar z)\) of the two points.%

This exercise reinforces what you just did with two points in the previous exercise. However, it now involves two people on a seesaw. Ignore the mass of the seesaw in your work below (pretend it's an extremely light seesaw, so its mass is negligible compared to the masses of the people).%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-121}

\item\label{task-575} My daughter and her friend are sitting on a seesaw.  Both girls have the same mass of 30 kg. My wife stands about 1 m behind my daughter. We'll measure distance in this exercise from my wife's perspective.  We can think of my daughter as a point mass located at \((1\text{m} ,0)\) whose mass is \(30\) kg. Suppose her friend is located at \((5\text{m} ,0)\). Suppose the kids are sitting just right so that the seesaw is perfectly balanced.  That means the the center of mass of the girls is precisely at the pivot point (or center) of the seesaw. Find the distance from my wife to the pivot point by finding the center of mass of the two girls.%
\item\label{task-576} My daughter's friend has to leave, so I plan to take her place on the seesaw. My mass is 100 kg. Her friend was sitting at the point \((5,0)\). I would like to sit at the point \((a,0)\) so that the seesaw is perfectly balanced. Without doing any computations, is \(a>5\) or \(a\lt 5\)? Explain.%
\item\label{task-577} Suppose I sit at the spot \((x,0)\) (perhaps causing my daughter or I to have a highly unbalanced ride). Find the center of mass of the two points \((1,0)\) and \((x,0)\) whose masses are \(30\) and \(100\), respectively (units are meters and kilograms).%
\item\label{task-578} Where should I sit so that the seesaw is perfectly balanced (what is \(a\))?%

In the previous exercises we focused on a system with two points \((x_1,y_1)\) and \((x_2,y_2)\) with masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\). The center of mass in the \(x\) direction is given by%
\begin{equation*}
\bar x = \frac{x_1m_1+x_2m_2}{m_1+m_2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^2x_i m_i}{\sum_{i=1}^2m_i}

\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-579} If we consider a system with 3 points, what formula gives the center of mass in the \(x\) direction? What if there are 4 points, 5 points, or \(n\) points?%
\item\label{task-580} Suppose now that we have a wire located along a curve \(C\). The density of the wire is known to be \(\delta(x,y,z)\) (which could be different at different points on the curve).  Imagine cutting the wire into a thousand or more tiny chunks.  Each chunk would be centered at some point \((x_i,y_i,z_i)\) and have length \(ds_i\). Explain why the mass of each little chunk is \(dm_i\approx\delta ds_i\).%
\item\label{task-581} Give a formula for the center of mass in the \(y\) direction of the thousands of points \((x_i,y_i,z_i)\), each with mass \(dm_i\). [This should almost be an exact copy of the first part.] Then explain why%
\begin{equation*}
\bar y = \frac{\int_C y dm}{\int_C dm}=\frac{\int_C y \delta ds}{\int_C \delta ds}.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
Ask me in class to show you another way to obtain the formula for center of mass. It involves looking at masses weighted by their distance (called a moment of mass). Many of you will have already seen an idea similar to this in statics, but in that class you are talking about moments of force, not moments of mass.%
\par
For quick reference, the formulas for the centroid of a wire along \(C\) are%
\begin{equation*}
\bar x = \frac{\int_C x ds}{\int_C  ds},
\bar y = \frac{\int_C y ds}{\int_C  ds}, 
\text{ and } 
\bar z = \frac{\int_C z ds}{\int_C  ds}.  \text{ (Centroid) }
\end{equation*}
%
\par
If the wire has density \(\delta\), then the formulas for the center of mass are %
\begin{equation*}
\bar x = \frac{\int_C x dm}{\int_C  dm},
\bar y = \frac{\int_C y dm}{\int_C  dm}, 
\text{ and } 
\bar z = \frac{\int_C z dm}{\int_C  dm},  \text{ (Center of mass) }
\end{equation*}
where \(dm=\delta ds\). Notice that the denominator in each case is just the mass \(m=\int_C dm\).%
\par
We'll often use the notation \((\bar x, \bar y,\bar z)\) to talk about both the centroid and the center of mass. If no density is given in a exercise, then \((\bar x, \bar y,\bar z)\) is the centroid. If a density is provided, then \((\bar x, \bar y,\bar z)\) refers to the center of mass. If the density is constant, it doesn't matter (the centroid and center of mass are the same, which is what the seesaw exercise showed).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-221}
Suppose a wire with density \(\delta(x,y)=x^2+y\) lies along the curve \(C\) which is the upper half of a circle around the origin with radius \(7\).%

\item\label{task-582} Parametrize \(C\) (find \(\vec r(t)\) and the domain for \(t\)).%
\item\label{task-583} Where is the wire heavier, at \((7,0)\) or \((0,7)\)?%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad Compute \(\delta\) at both.%
\item\label{task-584} In {$\langle\langle$Unresolved xref, reference "semicircle\_centroid"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute$\rangle\rangle$}, we showed that the centroid of the wire is \((\bar x, \bar y) = \left(0,\frac{2(7)}{\pi})\right)\). We now seek the center of mass.%

You've finished the chapter! Look at the objectives at the beginning of the chapter. Can you now do all the things you were promised?%

\emph{Review Guide Creation}%
\par
Your assignment: organize what you've learned into a small collection of examples that illustrates the key concepts. I'll call this your chapter review guide. I'll provide you with a template which includes the chapter's key concepts from the objectives at the beginning. Once you finish your review guide, scan it into a PDF document (use any scanner on campus or photo software) and upload it to Gradescope. %
\par
As you create this review guide, consider the following: \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Before each Celebration of Knowledge  we will devote a class period to review. With well created lesson plans, you will have 4-8 pages(for 2-4 Chapters) to review for each, instead of 50-100 problems.%
\item{}Think ahead 2-5 years. If you make these lesson plans correctly, you'll be able to look back at your lesson plans for this semester. In about 20-25 pages, you can have the entire course summarized and easy for you to recall.%

\item{}computing the directional derivative%
\end{itemize}
%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-38}
The directional derivative of \(f\) in the direction of the unit vector \(\vec u\) at a point \(P\) is defined to be%
\begin{equation*}
D_{\vec u} f(P) = Df(P) \hat u = \vec \nabla f \cdot \hat u.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Here are the steps to compute the directional derivative: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-174}{}If \(\vec{d}\) is not a unit vector, compute \(\hat{u}=\frac{\vec{d}}{|\vec{d}|}\)%
\item\hypertarget{li-175}{}Find \(Df=\vec{\nabla} f\)%

\item\hypertarget{li-177}{}Find the dot product:  \(\vec \nabla f \cdot \hat u\)%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
The partial derivative of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) is precisely the directional derivative of \(f\) in the \((1,0)\) direction.%
\par
Similarly, the partial derivative of \(f\) with respect to \(y\) is precisely the directional derivative of \(f\) in the \((0,1)\) direction. This definition extends to higher dimensions.%
\end{definition}
Note that in the definition above, we require the vector \(\vec u\) to be a unit vector. If you are asked to find a directional derivative in some direction, make sure you start by finding a unit vector in that direction. We want to deal with unit vectors because when we say something has a slope of \(m\) units, we want to say ``The function `rises' \(m\) units if we `run' \(1\) unit.''%

\item\label{task-613} At the point \(P=(2,1)\), place a dot on your graph. Then draw a unit vector based at \(P\) that points in the direction \(\vec u=(3,4)\) [not to the point \((3,4)\), but in the direction \(\vec u=(3,4)\)]. If you were to move in the direction \((3,4)\), starting from the point \((2,1)\), would the value of \(f\) increase or decrease?%
\item\label{task-614} Find the slope of \(f\) at \(P=(2,1)\) in the direction \(\vec u=(3,4)\) by finding the directional derivative. This should agree with your previous answer.%

You notice in one section of the map that the contour lines are really close together, and they start to form circles around a spot on the graph. You notice in another section of the map that the contour lines are spaced quite far apart.

\typeout{Subsection 10.2.1 The Multi-Dimensional Second Derivative Test}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{The Multi-Dimensional Second Derivative Test}]{The Multi-Dimensional Second Derivative Test}\label{subsection-59}
We now generalize the second derivative test to all dimensions. We've already seen that the second derivative of a function such as \(z=f(x,y)\) is a square matrix. The second derivative test in Calculus I/II relied on understanding if a function was concave up or concave down. We need a way to examine the concavity of \(f\) as we approach a point \((x,y)\) from any of the infinitely many directions. Such a method exists, and leads to an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem. I'm assuming that most of you have never heard the word ``eigenvalue.'' We could spend an entire semester just studying eigenvectors. We'd need a few weeks to discover what they are from a exercise-based approach. Instead, here is an example of how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-39}
Let \(A\) be a square matrix, so in 2D we have \(A=\begin{pmatrix}a\amp b\\c\amp d
\end{pmatrix}\). The identity matrix \(I\) is a square matrix with 1's on the diagonal and zeros everywhere else, so in 2D we have \(I = \begin{pmatrix}1\amp 0\\0\amp 1
\end{pmatrix}\). The eigenvalues of \(A\) are the solutions \(\lambda\) to the equation \(|A-\lambda I|=0\). Remember that \(|A|\) means, ``Compute the determinant of \(A\).'' So in 2D, we need to find the value \(\lambda\) so that \(\left|\begin{pmatrix}a\amp b\\c\amp d
\end{pmatrix} -\lambda  \begin{pmatrix}1\amp 0\\0\amp 1
\end{pmatrix}  \right|=\begin{vmatrix} a-\lambda \amp b\\c\amp d-\lambda \end{vmatrix}=0.\)%
\par
This definition extends to any square matrix. In 3D, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the equation \(\left|\begin{pmatrix}a\amp b\amp c\\d\amp e\amp f\\g\amp h\amp i
\end{pmatrix} -\lambda 
\begin{pmatrix}1\amp 0\amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp 0\\0\amp 0\amp 1
\end{pmatrix}  \right| = 
\begin{vmatrix} a-\lambda\amp b\amp c\\d\amp e-\lambda\amp f\\g\amp h\amp i-\lambda\end{vmatrix}=0.\)%
\par
An eigenvector of \(A\) corresponding to \(\lambda\) is a nonzero vector \(\vec x\) such that \(A\vec x=\lambda x\).%
\end{definition}
As you continue taking more upper level science courses (in physics, engineering, mathematics, chemistry, and more) you'll soon see that eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a huge role. You'll start to see them in most of your classes. For now, we'll use them without proof to apply the second derivative test. In class, make sure you ask me to show you pictures with each exercise we do, so we can see how eigenvalues and eigenvectors appear in surfaces.%
\begin{theorem}[{The Second Derivative Test}]\label{theorem-8}
Let \(f(x,y)\) be a function so that all the second partial derivatives exist and are continuous. The second derivative of \(f\), written \(D^2f\) and sometimes called the Hessian of \(f\), is a square matrix. Let \(\lambda_1\) be the largest eigenvalue of \(D^2f\), and \(\lambda_2\) be the smallest eigenvalue. Then \(\lambda_1\) is the largest possible second derivative obtained in any direction. Similarly, the smallest possible second derivative obtained in any direction is \(\lambda_2\). The eigenvectors give the directions in which these extreme second derivatives are obtained. The second derivative test states the following.%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-8}{}
Suppose \((a,b)\) is a critical point of \(f\), meaning \(Df(a,b) = \begin{bmatrix}0\amp 0
\end{bmatrix}\). \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}If all the eigenvalues of \(D^2f(a,b)\) are positive, then in every direction the function is concave upwards at \((a,b)\) which means the function has a local minimum at \((a,b)\).%
\item{}If all the eigenvalues of \(D^2f(a,b)\) are negative, then in every direction the function is concave downwards at \((a,b)\). This means the function has a local maximum at \((a,b)\).%
\item{}If the smallest eigenvalue of \(D^2f(a,b)\) is negative, and the largest eigenvalue of \(D^2f(a,b)\) is positive, then  in one direction the function is concave upwards, and in another the function is concave downwards. The point \((a,b)\) is called a saddle point.%
\item{}If the largest or smallest eigenvalue of \(f\) equals 0, then the second derivative tests yields no information.%
\end{itemize}

\end{theorem}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-2}
Consider the function \(f(x,y)=x^2-2x+xy+y^2\). The first and second derivatives are%
\begin{equation*}
Df(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix}2x-2+y,x+2y
\end{bmatrix} 
\text{ and }  
D^2f = \begin{bmatrix}2\amp 1 \\1\amp 2
\end{bmatrix} .
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The first derivative is zero (the zero matrix) when both \(2x-2+y=0\) and \(x+2y=0\). We need to solve the system of equations \(2x+y=2\) and \(x+2y=0\). Double the second equation, and then subtract it from the first to obtain \(0x-3y=2\), or \(y=-2/3\). The second equation says that \(x=-2y\), or that \(x=4/3\). So the only critical point is \((4/3,-2/3)\).%
\par
We find the eigenvalues of \(D^2 f(4/3,-2/3)\) by solving the equation \(\begin{vmatrix}2-\lambda\amp 1 \\1\amp 2-\lambda\end{vmatrix} = (2-\lambda)(2-\lambda)-1=0.\)%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-126}
In this example, the second derivative is constant, so the point \((4/3,-2/3)\) did not change the matrix. In general, the point will affect your matrix. See \href{http://aleph.sagemath.org/?q=775b0c4a-fc2c-4d39-8c30-ac5256cfb68a}{Sage} to see a graph which shows the eigenvectors in which the largest and smallest second derivatives occur.%
\end{aside}
Expanding the left hand side gives us {\(4-4\lambda + \lambda^2 -1 = 0\)}. Simplifying and factoring gives us \(\lambda^2-4\lambda +3 = (\lambda-3)(\lambda -1) = 0\). This means the eigenvalues are \(\lambda = 1\) and \(\lambda=3\). Since both numbers are positive, the function is concave upwards in every direction. The critical point \((4/3,-2/3)\) corresponds to a local minimum of the function. The local minimum is the output \(f(4/3,-2/3) = (4/3)^2-2(4/3)+(4/3)(-2/3)+(-2/3)^2\).%
\par
A link to the graph of \(f\) is provided on the right. The red vector \((1,1)\) points in the direction in which the second derivative is the largest value 3. The blue vector \((-1,1)\) points in the direction in which the second derivative is the smallest value 1. These vectors are called eigenvectors, and you can learn much more about them, in particular how to find them, in a linear algebra course. For this course, we just need to be able to find eigenvalues.%

You now have the tools needed to find optimal solutions to exercises in any dimension. Here's a silly exercise that demonstrates how we can use this.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{optimize_box_in_cake}
Prof. Woodruff's daughter has asked for a Barbie princess cake. He purchased a metal pan that's roughly in the shape of a paraboloid \(z=f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2\) for \(z\geq 0\). To surprise her, he want to hide a present inside the cake. The present is a bunch of small candy that can pretty much fill a box of any size. He'd like to know how large (biggest volume) of a rectangular box he can fit under the cake, so that when she starts cutting the cake, she'll find her surprise present. The box will start at \(z=0\) and the corners of the box (located at \((x,\pm y)\) and \((-x,\pm y)\)) will touch the surface of the cake \(z=9-x^2-y^2\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-647} What is the function \(V(x,y)\) that we are trying to maximize?%
\item\label{task-648} If you find all the critical points of \(V\), you'll discover there are 9.  However, only one of these critical points makes sense in the context of this exercise. Find that critical point.%
\item\label{task-649} Use the second derivative test to prove that the critical point yields a maximum volume.%
\item\label{task-650} What are the dimensions of the box? What's the volume of the box?%
\end{enumerate}
\bigbreak
The only thing left for Prof. Woodruff to now determine how much candy he should buy to fill the box. He'll take care of that.%
\end{exploration}
In this exercise, we'll derive the version of the second derivative test that is found in most multivariate calculus texts. The test given below only works for functions of the form \(f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}\). The eigenvalue test you have been practicing will work with a function of the form \(f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}\), for any natural number \(n\).%

The cake exercise was an example of an optimization problem where we wish to optimize a function (the volume of a box) subject to a constraint (the box has to fit inside a cake). If you are an economics student, this section may be the key reason why you were asked to take multivariate calculus. In the business world, we often want to optimize something (profit, revenue, cost, utility, etc.) subject to some constraint (a limited budget, a demand curve, warehouse space, employee hours, etc.). An aerospace engineer will build the best wing that can withstand given forces. Everywhere in the engineering world, we often seek to create the ``best'' thing possible, subject to some outside constraints. Lagrange discovered an extremely useful method for answering this question, and today we call it ``Lagrange Multipliers.''%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-127}
See Wikipedia's entry on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier}{Lagrange Multipliers} for more background on them.%
\end{aside}
Rather than introduce Cobb-Douglass production functions (from economics) or sheer-stress calculations (from engineering), we'll work with simple examples that illustrate the key points. Sometimes silly examples carry the message across just as well.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-239}
Suppose an ant walks around the circle \(g(x,y)=x^2+y^2=1\). As the ant walks around the circle, the temperature is \(f(x,y) = x^2+y+4\). Our goal is to find the maximum and minimum temperatures reached by the ant as it walks around the circle. We want to optimize \(f(x,y)\) subject to the constraint \(g(x,y)=1\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-658} Draw the circle \(g(x,y)=1\).  Then, on the same set of axes, draw several level curves of \(f\). The level curves \(f=3, 4, 5, 6\) are a good start. Then add more (maybe at each 1/4th). If you make a careful, accurate graph, it will help a lot below.%
\item\label{task-659} Based solely on your graph, where does the minimum temperature occur?  What is the minimum temperature?%
\item\label{task-660} If the ant is at the point \((0,1)\), and it moves left, will the temperature rise or fall?  What if the ant moves right?%
\item\label{task-661} On your graph, place a dot(s) where you believe the ant reaches a maximum temperature (it may occur at more than one spot).%
\item\label{task-662} Explain why you believe this is the spot where the maximum temperature occurs. What about the level curves tells you that these spots should be a maximum?%
\item\label{task-663} Draw the gradient of \(f\) at the places where the minimum and maximum temperatures occur. Also draw the gradient of \(g\) at these spots.%
\item\label{task-664} Explain how are gradients of \(f\) and \(g\) related at these spots.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{theorem}[{Lagrange Multipliers}]\label{theorem-9}
Suppose \(f\) and \(g\) are continuously differentiable functions. Suppose that we want to find the maximum and minimum values of \(f\) subject to the constraint \(g(x,y)=c\) (where \(c\) is some constant). Then if a maximum or minimum occurs, it must occur at a spot where the gradient of \(f\) and the gradient of \(g\) point in the same, or opposite, directions. So the gradient of \(g\) must be a multiple of the gradient of \(f\). To find the maximum and minimum values (if they exist), we just solve the system of equations that result from%
\begin{equation*}
\vec \nabla f = \lambda \vec \nabla g, \text{ and }  g(x,y)=c
\end{equation*}
where \(\lambda\) is the proportionality constant. The maximum and minimum values will be among the solutions of this system of equations.%

\textbf{Hint.}\quad The distance to the origin is \(d(x,y)=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.\) This distance is minimized when \(f(x,y) = x^2+y^2\) is minimized. So use \(f(x,y)=x^2+y^2\) as the function you wish to minimize. What's the constraint \(g(x,y)=c\)?%

\item{}practice setting up bounds and regions for double integrals.%
\item{}compute basic double integrals.%
\item{}understand how and why to switch the order of integration.%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
Before we introduce integration, let's practice using inequalities to describe regions in the plane. In first semester calculus, we often use the inequalities \(a\leq x\leq b\) and \(g(x)\leq y\leq f(x)\) to describe the region above \(g\) below \(f\) for \(x\) between \(a\) and \(b\). We trapped \(x\) between two constants, and \(y\) between two functions. Sometimes we wrote \(c\leq y\leq d\) where \(g(y)\leq x\leq f(y)\) to describe the region to the right of \(g\) and left of \(f\) for \(y\) between \(c\) and \(d\). We need to practice writing inequalities in this form, as these inequalities provide us the bounds of integration for double integrals.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-244}
Consider the region \(R\) in the \(xy\)-plane that is below the line \(y=x+2\), above the line \(y=2\), and left of the line \(x=5\). We can describe this region by saying for each \(x\) with \(0\leq x\leq 5\), we want \(y\) to satisfy \(2\leq y\leq x+2\). In set builder notation, we would write%
\begin{equation*}
R=\{(x,y)\ | \ 0\leq x\leq 5, 2\leq y\leq x+2\}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The symbols \(\{\) and \(\}\) are used to enclose sets, and the symbol \(|\) stands for ``such that''. We read the above line as ``\(R\) equals the set of \((x,y)\) such that zero is less than \(x\) which is less than 5, and 2 is less than \(y\) which is less than \(x+2\).''%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-669} Describe the region \(R\) by saying for each \(y\) with \(c\leq y\leq d\), we want \(x\) to satisfy \(a(y)\leq x\leq b(y)\). In other words, find constants \(c\) and \(d\), and functions \(a(y)\) and \(b(y)\), so that for each \(y\) between \(c\) and \(d\), the \(x\) values must be between the functions \(a(y)\) and \(b(y)\).%
\item\label{task-670} Write your last answer in the set builder notation%
\begin{equation*}
R=\{(x,y)\ | \ c\leq y\leq d, a(y)\leq x\leq b(y)\}.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{enumerate}
\bigbreak
If your struggling, then draw the 4 curves given by \(0=x\), \(x= 5\), \(2=y\) and \(y= x+2\). Then shade either above, below, left, or right of the line (as appropriate).%
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-245}
For each region \(R\) below, draw the region and give a set of inequalities of the form \(a\leq x\leq b, c(x)\leq y\leq d(x)\) or in the form \(c\lt y\lt d, a(y)\leq x\leq b(y)\). In class, we'll give whichever one you did not.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-671} The region \(R\) is above the line \(x+y=1\) and inside the circle \(x^2+y^2=1\).%
\item\label{task-672} The region \(R\) is below the line \(y=8\), above the curve \(y=x^2\), and to the right of the \(y\)-axis.%
\item\label{task-673} The region \(R\) is bounded by \(2x+y=3\), \(y=x\), and \(x=0\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
We're now ready to discuss double integrals. Just as single integrals gave us the area under a function over an interval, double integrals will give us the volume under a function, above a region in the plane. We'll introduce double integrals by looking at cross sections of a solid. You did this in first semester calculus, but you always used geometric shapes, for which we know the area, to create the cross sections. Let's start with a review of this idea, and then jump into double integrals.%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-24}
Consider the parabola \(z=9-x^2\) for \(0\leq x\leq 3\). Revolve this parabola half way around the \(z\)-axis, and compute the volume of the solid that is inside the paraboloid and above the \(xy\)-plane. Do so by considering horizontal semicircular cross sections. See\footnote{The area of each cross section is the area of a semicircle, which is \(A=\frac{1}{2}\pi r^2 = \frac12 \pi x^2\) as the radius is \(x\). We thicken each cross section up by multiplying by \(dz\), the height of each circular disc. Since the height has a \(dz\), we replace \(x\) with \(x=\sqrt{9-z}\) in the area formula to get a little bit of volume as \(dV = \frac{1}{2}\pi (\sqrt{9-z})^2 dz\).  The \(z\) values range from \(0\) to \(9\), which means the volume of the solid is the integral%
\begin{equation*}
V
=\int_0^9 \frac{1}{2}\pi (\sqrt{9-z})^2 dz
=\frac{\pi}{2}\int_0^9  9-z dz
=\frac{\pi}{2}  \left(9z-\frac{z^2}{2}\right)\bigg|_0^9
=\frac{81\pi}{4}
\end{equation*}
\label{fn-9}}.%
\end{project}
Let's now consider the exact same solid, but instead of cutting horizontally, let's cut the object vertically. The first exercise has you cut the solid up using slices that are parallel to the \(x\)-axis (so keeping \(y\) constant). The next has you repeat the exercise, but this time using vertical slices that are parallel to the \(y\)-axis (so keeping \(x\) constant). The idea is exactly the same.

Please \href{http://bmw.byuimath.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=cross_sections_of_solid_by_letting_y_equal_a_constant}{click on this Sage link.} In this picture, you'll see the solid \(D\) drawn. You'll also see several cross sections of the surface (half parabolas), each one obtained by letting \(y\) equal a constant (\(y=-2, -1,0,1,2\)). When \(y_i=0\), the half parabola has area \(\int_0^3 9-x^2dx\). When \(y_i=2\), the half parabola has area \(\int_0^? 5-x^2dx\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-674} When \(y=y_i\), explain why the area of each of the cross sections from the first part is%
\begin{equation*}
A_{y=y_i}=\ds \int_0^{\sqrt{9-y_i^2}} (9-x^2-y_i^2) dx.

The integral above is called an iterated integral because you first compute the inside integral and then you compute the outside integral (you iteratively integrate). Often the parenthesis are not written because we know that the inside integral should be performed first without writing the parenthesis. We could also explicitly emphasize which variables go with each bound by writing%
\begin{equation*}
\ds\int_{y=-3}^{y=3} \left(\int_{x=0}^{x=\sqrt{9-y^2}}9-x^2-y^2 dx\right) dy.
\end{equation*}

This latter approach is not commonly used, but can save a beginner from making simple errors.%

The first two exercises show that the volume of \(D\) can be given by%
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}
%
\par
We have two completely different iterated integrals that result in the exact same volume. In both integrals, the bounds on \(x\) and \(y\) describe a semicircular region \(R\) in the \(xy\) plane. The region \(R\) is fully described by using the inequalities \(-3\leq y\leq 3\) and \(0\leq x\leq \sqrt{9-y^2}\) from the first integral, or using the inequalities \(0\leq x\leq 3\) and \(-\sqrt{9-x^2}\leq y\leq \sqrt{9-x^2}\) from the second integral.%
\par
In the previous exercises, we computed the volume of solid by considering cross sections of the solid. We could also cut the solid up in both the \(x\) and \(y\) dimensions. This would result in tiny rectangles in the \(xy\) plane with area \(dA=dxdy=dydx\), and the solid would have height \(f(x,y)\) above these rectangles. This means we would have a little bit of volume written as%
\begin{equation*}
dV=fdA=fdxdy=fdydx.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Adding up these little bits of volume gives us the double integral%
\begin{equation*}
V = \iint_R fdA=\iint_R fdydx=\iint_R fdxdy.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
We can either set up the bounds with \(x\) on the inside, or \(y\) on the inside. We'll get the same answer. When we set up the integral with bounds, we call it an iterated integral, and write.%
\begin{equation*}
\ds \int_a^b \int_{c(x)}^{d(x)}f(x,y)dydx  \text{ or }  
\ds \int_c^d \int_{a(y)}^{b(y)}f(x,y)dxdxy.
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{definition}[{Double and Iterated Integrals}]\label{definition-40}
A double integral is written \(\ds \iint_R f(x,y)dA\). We just have to state what the region \(R\) is to talk about a double integral. The formal definition of a double integrals involves slicing the region \(R\) up into tiny rectangles of area \(dxdy\), multiplying each rectangle by a height \(f\), and then summing over all rectangles. This process is repeated as the length and width of the rectangles shrinks to zero at similar rates, with the double integral being the limit of this process.%
\par
An iterated integral is a double integral where we have actually set up the bounds as either%
\begin{equation*}
\ds \int_a^b \int_{c(x)}^{d(x)}f(x,y)dydx  \text{ or }  
\ds \int_c^d \int_{a(y)}^{b(y)}f(x,y)dxdxy.

This section covers... \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Applications of double integrals: Averages, Centroids (and others)%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
In the line integral chapter, we introduced the ideas of average value, centroid, and center of mass. We now extend those ideas to regions in the plane, in exactly the same way. For example, the average value formula in the line integral section was \(\bar f = \dfrac{\int_C fdx}{\int_C ds}\). For double integrals, we just change \(ds\) to \(dA\), and add an integral. This gives the formula \(\bar f = \dfrac{\iint_R fdA}{\iint_R dA}.\) The same substitution works on all the integrals from before. We now have \(dm = \delta dA\) instead of \(dm=\delta ds\), as now density is a mass per area, instead of a mass per length. We obtained the arc length of a curve \(C\) by computing \(s=\int_C ds\), as we just add up little bits of arc length. We can obtain the area of a region \(R\) by computing \(A=\iint_R dA\), as we just add up little bits of area.%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-136}
Average value formula%
\end{aside}
The centroid of a region \(R\) in the plane is:%
\begin{equation*}
\left(\bar x = \frac{\iint_R x dA}{\iint_R dA}, 
\bar y = \frac{\iint_R y dA}{\iint_R dA}\right)
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-137}
Centroid Formula%
\end{aside}
and the center of mass is%
\begin{equation*}
\left(\bar x = \frac{\iint_R x  dm}{\iint_R dm}, 
\bar y = \frac{\iint_R y dm}{\iint_R dm}\right), \text{ where \(dm=\delta dA\) } .
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-138}
Center of Mass Formula%
\end{aside}
One of the main reasons we are studying mass, center of mass, centroids, etc., is so that we can understand energy. The transfer of energy (for example from kinetic to electrical and then back from electrical to kinetic) is one of the most important ideas in modern innovations.%
\par
Some of you may have already had a physics class, in which you learned that the kinetic energy of an object with mass \(m\) moving at speed \(v\) is%
\begin{equation*}
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
If an object has a large mass, it takes a lot of work (transfer of energy) to get the object moving. Mass is an object's resistance to straight line motion.%
\par
When something rotates, we need a handy way to compute its kinetic energy. We'll show that the kinetic energy of an object that is rotating about a line \(L\), and has an angular velocity of \(\omega\) radians per second about the line, is precisely %
\begin{equation*}
KE = \frac{1}{2}I \omega^2,
\end{equation*}
where \(I\) is the (second) moment of inertia. If an object has a large inertia, it takes a lot of work (transfer of energy) to get the object rotating. Inertia is like an object's resistance to rotational motion.%
\begin{definition}[{Moment of Inertia}]\label{definition-41}
We can obtain the moment of inertia by integrating \(I=\iint_R (d)^2 dm\) where \(d\) is the radius of rotation about the axis \(L\) of rotation, which means that \(d\) is distance from a point \((x,y,z)\) to the axis of rotation \(L\). If the line \(L\) is one of the coordinate axes, then we obtain the key formulas%
\begin{equation*}
I_x = \iint_R (y^2)dm,
I_y = \iint_R (x^2)dm,
I_z = \iint_R (x^2+y^2)dm
.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{definition}
If you have never worked with kinetic energy before, you may skip the next exercise and then just practice using these formulas.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-252}
Suppose that an object, whose mass is \(m\), is attached to a string (whose mass is so small we'll ignore it). We rotate the object about a point, where the angular velocity is \(\omega\) radians per second. The length of the string (distance from the point to the center of rotation) is \(d\).%

\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-698} Explain why the speed of the object \(v=\omega d\).%
\item\label{task-699} \begin{aside}{}\label{aside-140}
The quantity \(I=d^2m\) is called the moment of inertia. However, this formula assumes that all the mass is located at a single point.%
\end{aside}
We know an object's kinetic energy \(KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\). Explain why the kinetic energy of the rotating object is \(KE = \frac{1}{2}d^2m\omega^2\).%
\item\label{task-700} Let's take our object, located at the point \(P(x,y)\), and rotate it about the \(x\)-axis, still with angular velocity \(\omega\). Find the kinetic energy of this point. [All you need is the distance \(d\) from the point \(P(x,y)\) to the \(x\)-axis.]%
\item\label{task-701} \begin{aside}{}\label{aside-141}
The inertia about the \(x\) axis is \(I_x = \ds \iint_R (y^2)dm = \iint_R (y^2)\delta dA\).%
\end{aside}
We can think of a region \(R\) in the plane as thousands of points \(P(x,y)\), each with mass \(dm=\delta dA\). As we rotate an entire object about the \(x\)-axis with angular velocity \(\omega\), each little piece contributes a small amount of kinetic energy. Explain why the total kinetic energy of the region \(R\), when rotated about the \(x\) axis at angular speed \(\omega\), is%
\begin{equation*}
KE= \frac{1}{2}\left(\iint_R (y^2)dm\right)\omega^2
\end{equation*}
.%

\end{aside}
If the triangular region had its corners at \((0,0)\), \((b,0)\), and \((0,h)\), state the center of mass \(\bar x\) and the moment of inertia \(I_x\). You should be able to complete this part by replacing the 5's and 7's in your formula with \(b\)'s and \(h\)'s, provided you first factor any really large numbers, like \(1715 = 5\cdot 343=5\cdot 7\cdot ?...\) (I'll let you finish factoring).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
When we found average value, we wanted a height \(\bar f\) such that the area under \(f\) and the area under \(\bar f\) were the same. As an equation, we wrote%
\begin{equation*}
\iint_R \bar f dA = \iint_R f dA,
\end{equation*}
and then since \(\bar f\) is constant, we pulled it out of the integral, and then solved for \(\bar f\) to get%
\begin{equation*}
\bar f \iint_R dA = \iint_R f dA 
\text{ or }  
\bar f  = \frac{\iint_R f dA }{\iint_R dA}
.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
This same process gives the center of mass. We could replace the variable distance \(x\) in \(\int_C x dm\) with the constant distance \(\bar x\), and then solve for \(\bar x\) in the equation \(\int_C \bar xdm = \int_C x dm\). If all the mass were located at one spot, what would that spot have to be for the first moments of mass to be the same. The radii of gyration are obtained in the exact same manner. We'll think of a radius of gyration as a rotational center of mass.%
\begin{exploration}[Radii of Gyration]\label{exploration-254}
\end{exploration}
You only needed to show how to obtain the radius of gyration about the \(z\) axis. All three radii of gyration are found using the formulas%
\begin{equation*}
R_x = \sqrt{\frac{\iint_R (y^2+z^2)dm}{\iint_R dm}},
R_y = \sqrt{\frac{\iint_R (x^2+z^2)dm}{\iint_R dm}},
\text{ and } 
R_z = \sqrt{\frac{\iint_R (x^2+y^2)dm}{\iint_R dm}}.
\end{equation*}
where \(dm=\delta(x,y) dA\). Note that in 2 dimensions, we have \(z=0\), so the formulas for \(R_x\) and \(R_y\) are simpler.%

One of the main reasons we are studying mass, center of mass, centroids, etc., is so that we can understand energy. The transfer of energy (for example from kinetic to electrical and then back from electrical to kinetic) is one of the most important ideas in modern innovations.%
\par
Some of you may have already had a physics class, in which you learned that the kinetic energy of an object with mass \(m\) moving at speed \(v\) is%
\begin{equation*}
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
If an object has a large mass, it takes a lot of work (transfer of energy) to get the object moving. Mass is an object's resistance to straight line motion.%
\par
When something rotates, we need a handy way to compute its kinetic energy. We'll show that the kinetic energy of an object that is rotating about a line \(L\), and has an angular velocity of \(\omega\) radians per second about the line, is precisely %
\begin{equation*}
KE = \frac{1}{2}I \omega^2,
\end{equation*}
where \(I\) is the (second) moment of inertia. If an object has a large inertia, it takes a lot of work (transfer of energy) to get the object rotating. Inertia is like an object's resistance to rotational motion.%
\begin{definition}[{Moment of Inertia}]\label{definition-42}
We can obtain the moment of inertia by integrating \(I=\iint_R (d)^2 dm\) where \(d\) is the radius of rotation about the axis \(L\) of rotation, which means that \(d\) is distance from a point \((x,y,z)\) to the axis of rotation \(L\). If the line \(L\) is one of the coordinate axes, then we obtain the key formulas%
\begin{equation*}
I_x = \iint_R (y^2)dm,
I_y = \iint_R (x^2)dm,
I_z = \iint_R (x^2+y^2)dm
.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{definition}
If you have never worked with kinetic energy before, you may skip the next exercise and then just practice using these formulas.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-260}
Suppose that an object, whose mass is \(m\), is attached to a string (whose mass is so small we'll ignore it). We rotate the object about a point, where the angular velocity is \(\omega\) radians per second. The length of the string (distance from the point to the center of rotation) is \(d\).%

\item\label{task-718} \begin{aside}{}\label{aside-148}
The quantity \(I=d^2m\) is called the moment of inertia. However, this formula assumes that all the mass is located at a single point.%
\end{aside}
We know an object's kinetic energy \(KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\). Explain why the kinetic energy of the rotating object is \(KE = \frac{1}{2}d^2m\omega^2\).%
\item\label{task-719} Let's take our object, located at the point \(P(x,y)\), and rotate it about the \(x\)-axis, still with angular velocity \(\omega\). Find the kinetic energy of this point. [All you need is the distance \(d\) from the point \(P(x,y)\) to the \(x\)-axis.]%
\item\label{task-720} \begin{aside}{}\label{aside-149}
The inertia about the \(x\) axis is \(I_x = \ds \iint_R (y^2)dm = \iint_R (y^2)\delta dA\).%
\end{aside}
We can think of a region \(R\) in the plane as thousands of points \(P(x,y)\), each with mass \(dm=\delta dA\). As we rotate an entire object about the \(x\)-axis with angular velocity \(\omega\), each little piece contributes a small amount of kinetic energy. Explain why the total kinetic energy of the region \(R\), when rotated about the \(x\) axis at angular speed \(\omega\), is%
\begin{equation*}
KE= \frac{1}{2}\left(\iint_R (y^2)dm\right)\omega^2
\end{equation*}
.%

We now want to explore how to perform \(u\)-substitution in high dimensions. Let's start with a review from first semester calculus.%
\begin{project}[]\label{project-25}
Consider the integral \(\ds\int_{-1}^4 e^{-3x} dx\). \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-200}{}Let \(u=-3x\).  Solve for \(x\) and then compute \(dx\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-201}{}Explain why \(\ds\int_{-1}^4 e^{-3x} dx=\int_{3}^{-12}e^u \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)du\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-202}{}Explain why \(\ds\int_{-1}^4 e^{-3x} dx=\int_{-12}^{3}e^u \left|-\frac{1}{3}\right| du\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-203}{}If the \(u\)-values are between \(-3\) and \(2\), what would the \(x\)-values be between? How does the  length of the \(u\) interval \([-3,2]\) relate to the length of the corresponding \(x\) interval?%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{project}
In the exercise above, we used a change of coordinates \(u=-3x\), or \(x=-1/3 u\). By taking derivatives, we found that \(dx=-\frac{1}{3}du\). The negative means that the orientation of the interval was reversed. The fraction \(\frac13\) tells us that lengths \(dx\) using \(x\) coordinates will be \(1/3\)rd as long as lengths \(du\) using \(u\) coordinates. When we write \(dx = \frac{dx}{du}du\), the number \(\frac{dx}{du}\) is called the Jacobian of \(x\) with respect to \(u\). The Jacobian tells us how lengths are altered when we change coordinate systems. We now generalize this to polar coordinates. Before we're done with this section, we'll generalize the Jacobian to any change of coordinates.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-261}
Consider the polar change of coordinates \(x=r\cos\theta\) and \(y=r\sin\theta\), which we could just write as%
\begin{equation*}
\vec T(r,\theta)=(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta).
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-151}
If you need a reminder of how to compute determinants, refer to \hyperref[sec_Determinants]{Section~\ref{sec_Determinants}}%

\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

\item\label{task-723} Compute the determinant of \(D\vec T(r,\theta)\) and simplify.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
The determinant you found above is called the Jacobian of the polar coordinate transformation. Let's summarize these results in a theorem.%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{theorem-10}
If we use the polar coordinate transformation \(x=r\cos\theta, y=r\sin\theta\), then we can switch from \((x,y)\) coordinates to \((r,\theta)\) coordinates if we use%
\begin{equation*}
dxdy=|r|drd\theta.
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-152}
Ask me in class to give you an informal picture approach that explains why \(dxdy=rdrd\theta\).%
\end{aside}
The number \(|r|\) is called the Jacobian of \(x\) and \(y\) with respect to \(r\) and \(\theta\). If we require all bounds for \(r\) to be nonnegative, we can ignore the absolute value. If \(R_{xy}\) is a region in the \(xy\) plane that corresponds to the region \(R_{r\theta}\) in the \(r\theta\) plane (where \(r\geq 0\)), then we can write%
\begin{equation*}
\iint_{R_{xy}} f(x,y) dxdy = \iint_{R_{r\theta}} f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta) r\ drd\theta.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{theorem}
We need some practice using this idea. We'll start by describing regions using inequalities on \(r\) and \(\theta\).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-262}
For each region \(R\) below, draw the region in the \(xy\)-plane. Then give a set of inequalities of the form \(a\leq r\leq b, \alpha(r)\leq \theta \leq \beta(r)\) or \(\alpha\lt \theta\lt \beta, a(\theta)\leq r\leq b(\theta)\). For example, if the region is the inside of the circle \(x^2+y^2=9\), then we could write \(0\leq \theta\leq 2\pi\), \(0\leq r\leq 3\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

To find the Jacobian of the transformation \(\vec T(u,v)=(x(u,v), y(u,v))\), we first find the derivative of \(\vec T\). This is a square matrix, so it has a determinant, which should give us information about area. As the determinant may be positive or negative, we then take the absolute value to obtain the Jacobian. Formally:%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-43}
Suppose \(\vec T(u,v)=(x(u,v),y(u,v))\) is a differentiable coordinate transformation. The Jacobian of the transformation \(\vec T\) is the absolute value of the determinant of the derivative. Notationally we write%

Suppose the region \(R_{uv}\) in the \(uv\)-plane corresponds to the region \(R_{xy}\) in the \(xy\)-plane.

\item{}Learn to use Green's Theorem to compute circulation/work and flux%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
Now that we have double integrals, it's time to make some of our circulation and flux exercises from the line integral section get extremely simple. We'll start by defining the circulation density and flux density for a vector field \(\vec F(x,y)=\left\lt M,N\right>\) in the plane.%
\begin{definition}[{Circulation Density and Flux Density (Divergence)}]\label{definition_of_flux_density_in_2D}
Let \(\vec F(x,y)=\left\lt M,N\right>\) be a continuously differentiable vector field. At the point \((x,y)\) in the plane, create a circle \(C_a\) of radius \(a\) centered at \((x,y)\), where the area inside of \(C_a\) is \(A_a=\pi a^2\). The quotient \(\ds \frac{1}{A_a}\oint_{C_a} \vec F \cdot \vec T ds\) is a circulation per area. The quotient \(\ds \frac{1}{A_a}\oint_{C_a} \vec F \cdot \vec n ds\) is a flux per area. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The circulation density of \(\vec F\) at \((x,y)\) we define to be%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}=N_x-M_y = \lim_{a\to 0} \frac{1}{A_a}\oint_{C_a} \vec F \cdot  d\vec r = 
\lim_{a\to 0} \frac{1}{A_a}\oint_{C_a} Mdx+Ndy.
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-158}
We will not prove that the partial derivative expressions \(N_x-M_y\) and \(M_x+N_y\) are actually equal to the limits given here. That is best left to an advanced course.%
\end{aside}
\item{}The divergence, or flux density, of \(\vec F\) at \((x,y)\) we define to be%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial M}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial N}{\partial y}=M_x+N_y=\lim_{a\to 0} \frac{1}{A_a}\oint_{C_a} \vec F \cdot \vec n ds = 
\lim_{a\to 0} \frac{1}{A_a}\oint_{C_a} Mdy-Ndx.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{definition}
In the definitions above, we could have replaced the circle \(C_a\) with a square of side lengths \(a\) centered at \((x,y)\) with interior area \(A_a\). Alternately, we could have chosen any collection of curves \(C_a\) which ``shrink nicely'' to \((x,y)\) and have area \(A_a\) inside. Regardless of which curves you chose, it can be shown that%
\begin{equation*}
N_x-M_y=\lim_{a\to 0} \frac{1}{A_a}\oint_{C_a} \vec F \cdot \vec T ds  \text{ and }   M_x+N_y=\lim_{a\to 0} \frac{1}{A_a}\oint_{C_a} \vec F \cdot \vec n ds.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
To understand what the circulation and flux density mean in a physical sense, think of \(\vec F\) as the velocity field of some gas. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The circulation density tells us the rate at which the vector field \(\vec F\) causes objects to rotate around points.  If circulation density is positive, then particles near \((x,y)\) would tend to circulate around the point in a counterclockwise direction. The larger the circulation density, the faster the rotation. The velocity field of a gas could have some regions where the gas is swirling clockwise, and some regions where the gas is swirling counterclockwise.%
\item{}The divergence, or flux density, tells us the rate at which the vector field causes object to either flee from \((x,y)\) or come towards \((x,y)\). For the velocity field of a gas, the gas is expanding at points where the divergence is positive, and contracting at points where the divergence is negative.%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
We are now ready to state Green's Theorem. Ask me in class to give an informal proof as to why this theorem is valid.%
\begin{theorem}[{Green's Theorem}]\label{theorem-12}
Let \(\vec F(x,y)=(M,N)\) be a continuously differentiable vector field, which is defined on an open region in the plane that contains a simple closed curve \(C\) and the region \(R\) inside the curve \(C\). Then we can compute the counterclockwise circulation of \(\vec F\) along \(C\), and the outward flux of \(\vec F\) across \(C\) by using the double integrals%
\begin{equation*}
\oint_{C} \vec F \cdot \vec T ds=\iint_R N_x-M_y dA 
\text{ and }   
\oint_{C} \vec F \cdot \vec n ds=\iint_R M_x+N_y dA.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{theorem}

In first-semester calculus, we learned how to compute integrals of the form \(\int_a^b f dx\) along straight (flat) segments \([a,b]\). This semester, in the line integral unit, we learned how to change the segment to a curve, which allowed us to compute integrals of the form \(\int_C fds\) along any curve \(C\), instead of just along curves (segments) on the \(x\)-axis.%
\par
The integral \(\int_a^b dx=b-a\) gives the length of the segment \([a,b]\).%
\par
The integral \(\int_C ds\) gives the length \(s\) of the curve \(C\).%
\par
In the double integral unit we learned how to compute double integrals \(\iint_R fdA\) along flat regions \(R\) in the plane. In this unit we will now learn how to change the flat region \(R\) into a curved surface \(S\), and then compute integrals of the form \(\iint_S fd\sigma\) along curved surfaces. The differential \(d\sigma\) stands for a little bit of surface area. We already know that \(\iint_R dA\) gives the area of \(R\). We'll define \(\iint_S d\sigma\) so that it gives the surface area of \(S\).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-274}
Consider the surface \(S\) given by \(z=9-x^2-y^2\) (we've seen this surface many times). A parametrization of this surface is%
\begin{equation*}
\vec r(x,y) = (x,y,9-x^2-y^2).
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-750} Draw the surface \(S\).%
\item\label{task-751} Add to your surface plot the parabolas given by \(\vec r(x,0)\), \(\vec r(x,1)\), and \(\vec r(x,2)\), as well as the parabolas given by \(\vec r(0,y)\), \(\vec r(1,y)\), and \(\vec r(2,y)\).%
\item\label{task-752} Find \(\ds \frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial x}\) and \(\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial y}\).%
\item\label{task-753} At the point \((2,1)\), draw both vectors.%
\item\label{task-754} These vectors form the edges of a parallelogram. Add that parallelogram to your picture.%
\item\label{task-755} Show that the area of a parallelogram whose edges are the vectors \(\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial x}(x,y)\) and \(\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial y}\) is \(\sqrt{1+4x^2+4y^2}\).%
\par\medskip\noindent%
\textbf{Hint.}\quad What was one part of the definition/meanings for the cross product.%
\item\label{task-756} Find the area of the parallelogram whose edges are the vectors \(\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial x}dx\) and \(\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial y}dy\), where \(dx\) and \(dy\) are not yet determined.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
In the previous problem, you showed that the area of the parallelogram with edges given by \(\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial x}dx\) and \(\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial y}dy\) is%
\begin{equation*}
d\sigma =\left |\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial x} \times \frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial y}\right| dxdy.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
This little bit of area approximates the area of a tiny patch on the surface. If we add all these areas up, we should obtain the surface area.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-45}
Let \(S\) be a surface. Let \(\vec r(u,v)=(x,y,z)\) be a parametrization of the surface, where the bounds on \(u\) and \(v\) form a region \(R\) in the \(uv\) plane. Then the surface area element (representing a little bit of surface) is%
\begin{equation*}
d\sigma =\left |\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial v}\right| dudv = \left|\vec r_u\times\vec r_v\right|dudv.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The surface integral of a continuous function \(f(x,y,z)\) along the surface \(S\) is%
\begin{equation*}
\iint_S f(x,y,z) d\sigma = \iint_R f(\vec r(u,v)) \left |\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial v}\right| dudv.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
If we let \(f=1\), then the surface area of \(S\) is simply%
\begin{equation*}
\sigma = \iint_S d\sigma = \iint_R \left |\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial v}\right| dudv.
\end{equation*}

\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Learn to compute flux across a surface (Gauss's Law)%
\end{itemize}
We now want to look at the flux of a vector field across a surface \(S\). In the line integral section, we defined the outward flux of a vector field \(F\) across a curve \(C\) to be the line integral \(\ds \int_C \vec F\cdot \vec n ds\), where \(\vec n\) is a normal vector point out of region enclosed by a curve \(C\). When we want to find the flux of a vector field across a surface, we must state in which direction we want to compute the flux. We then must make sure that normal vector \(\vec n\) we choose to use actually points in the desired direction. The flux of a vector field \(\vec F\) across a surface \(S\) is the surface integral%
\begin{equation*}
\text{ Flux } =\Phi 
= \iint_S \vec F\cdot \vec n d\sigma 
.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The next problem will help us simplify the computation of \(\vec nd\sigma\).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-281}
For both parts of this exercise, the computations involved were actually done in previous problems. You just need to compile the information here.%
\par
Consider again the surface \(z=9-x^2-y^2\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-774} \begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\roman*),ref=\theenumi.\roman*]
\item\label{task-775} Find a unit normal vector \(\vec n\) to the surface so that \(\vec n\) points upwards away from the \(z\)-axis. Make sure you explain how you know the normal vector you give is pointing upwards away from the \(z\) axis.%
\item\label{task-776} State what \(d\sigma\) equals, as well as \(\vec n d\sigma\).%
\end{enumerate}
\item\label{task-777} \begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\roman*),ref=\theenumi.\roman*]
\item\label{task-778} Find a unit normal vector \(\vec n\) to the surface so that \(\vec n\) points downwards towards the \(z\)-axis. Make sure you explain how you know the normal vector you give is pointing downwards towards the \(z\) axis.%
\item\label{task-779} State what \(d\sigma\) equals, as well as \(\vec n d\sigma\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
In the problem above, we showed that \(\vec n d\sigma = \pm(\vec r_x\times\vec r_y)dxdy\) and that \(\vec n d\sigma = \pm(\vec r_r\times\vec r_\theta)drd\theta\). We no longer need to find the magnitude of the cross product, but we must determine the correct sign to put on our cross product. This shows us that we can write flux as%
\begin{equation*}
\text{ Flux } =\Phi 
= \iint_S \vec F\cdot \vec n d\sigma 
= \iint_{R_{uv}} \vec F\cdot (\pm \vec r_u\times \vec r_v) dudv
.

\par
Consider the cone \(z^2=x^2+y^2\) and vector field \(\vec F = (2x+3y, x-2y, yz)\). Set up an iterated integral that would give the flux of \(\vec F\) outwards (away from the \(z\)-axis) for the portion of the cone between \(z=1\) and \(z=3\).%
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-283}
Consider the cone \(z^2=x^2+y^2\) and vector field \(\vec F = (2x+3y, x-2y, yz)\). We want to set up an iterated integral that would give the flux of \(\vec F\) outwards (away from the \(z\)-axis) for the portion of the cone between \(z=1\) and \(z=3\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-780} Start by  parameterizing the cone by using a polar parametrization%
\begin{equation*}
x=r\cos\theta, y=r\sin\theta, z=?.
\end{equation*}
%
\item\label{task-781} Next obtain bounds for \(r\) and \(\theta\) that are constants.%
\item\label{task-782} Compute the normal vector and look at the third component to determine if it points up or down.%
\item\label{task-783} Finally just plug everything into the formula.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
When the surface is flat, often you can determine the normal vector without having to perform any cross products. We'll now compute a flux of a vector field outwards across the 6 faces of a cube.%

We are going to take a short aside now to define two operators: the curl and the divergence. These operators provide insight into how vector fields are behaving and have direct applications to understanding circulation, flux and flow. We'll come back to those applications once we are comfortable with computing each operation.%
\par
Before we define them though, we need a bit of notation. We've been writing \(\vec \nabla f\) for the gradient. This gives us a vector of partial derivatives: \(\vec \nabla f= \left[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x},\frac{\partial f}{\partial y},\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right]\). We want to now separate out \(\vec \nabla\) which we'll call the `del' operator. We define `del' as \(\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial y},\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\rangle\). If we treat this as a vector in its own right, we can perform vector operations (dot and cross product) between \(\vec \nabla\) and vector fields \(\vec{F}(x,y,z)\). This will give us the tools to define the curl and divergence.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 12.2.1 The Divergence}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{The Divergence}]{The Divergence}\label{subsection-64}
The first vector operation we learned was the dot product. We now use the dot product between \(\vec \nabla\) and a vector field to define the divergence:%
\begin{align*}
\text{ div } \vec F(x,y,z) 
\amp = \vec \nabla\cdot \vec F 
= \left(\frac{\partial }{\partial x},\frac{\partial }{\partial y},\frac{\partial }{\partial z} \right)\cdot (M,N,P)\\
\amp = \frac{\partial M}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial N}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial P}{\partial z} 
= M_x+N_y+P_z 
.
\end{align*}
%

Can you make a general statement about how a 2-D vector field looks for it to have non-zero divergence?%

Now let's take a look at some 3-D fields. You should still plot them in Sage or Wolfram-Alpha, but don't worry about sketching a plot (unless you want to).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{x3d_div}

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{The Curl}]{The Curl}\label{subsection-65}
Instead of computing the dot product between \(\vec \nabla\) and \(\vec F\) we could compute the cross product. This gives us the curl of a vector field.%
\par
We call the vector \(\left\lt P_y-N_z,M_z-P_x,N_x-M_y\right>\) the curl of \(\vec F\) and we write%
\begin{align*}
\text{ curl } (\vec F) 
\amp = \vec \nabla \times \vec F\\
\amp = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial y},\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right) \times (M,N,P)\\
\amp = \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial N}{\partial z}, \frac{\partial M}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial x},\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right)\\
\amp =  \left(P_y-N_z,M_z-P_x,N_x-M_y\right)
\end{align*}
%
\par
The notation \(\vec \nabla \times \vec F\) gives a convenient way to remember the formula, as%
\begin{align*}
\text{ curl } (\vec F)=\vec \nabla \times \vec F 
\amp =\det \begin{bmatrix}
\vec i \amp  \vec j \amp  \vec k\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\amp \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\amp \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\\
M\amp N\amp P

\amp = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}P-\frac{\partial}{\partial z}N,\frac{\partial}{\partial z}M-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}P,\frac{\partial}{\partial x}N-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}M\right)
\end{align*}
%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{theorem-13}
The curl of a vector field is the direction of the greatest circulation density, and the magnitude of the curl is the circulation density in that direction. If a vector field causes a large amount of circulation in one direction, then the curl will be a long vector. The circulation density of \(\vec F\) at \((x,y,z)\) about \(\vec u\), written \(\text{ curl } (\vec F)\cdot \vec u\) is largest when \(\vec u\) points in the same direction as \(\text{ curl }  F\).%
\end{theorem}
Let's take a look now at several vector fields, to get intuition about what curl is really telling us.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{x2dcurl}
These are the same vector fields from \hyperref[x2d_div]{Exercise~1}.%
\par
Find the curl%
\par
for each vector field:%
\begin{aside}{}\label{aside-168}
See \href{http://mathinsight.org/curl_components}{MathInsight.org} for a really nice animation of the curl of a vector field.%
\end{aside}
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-794} \(\vec{F}(x,y)=(x,y)\)%
\item\label{task-795} \(\vec{F}(x,y)=(y,x)\)%

\item\label{task-797} \(\vec{F}(x,y)=(x-y^2+2, xy+y)\)%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
You should have noticed that for all of the above vector-fields, the curl was only in the \(z\)-direction. Let's do a quick problem to explore this.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{show2dcurl}
For a vector field \(\vec{F}= ( M(x,y), N(x,y), 0 )\), compute \(curl( \vec{F})\). That is, assume that \(P(x,y,z)=0\)%
\end{exploration}
One common way to quickly decide if a 2-D field has a curl at a point is to imagine placing a paddle-wheel (like on an old-fashion water mill or steamboat) in the vector-field. If the paddle would spin, then there's a curl. If it spins counter-clockwise then the curl is positive. You can see this idea illustrated by visiting \href{http://www.math.harvard.edu/\~knill/pitf/2dcurldiv.html}{this site}.%
\par
We will use this 2-D version to rewrite Green's Theorem in the following section. Let's get a little more practice computing curl. This time, the vector fields are all three-dimensional. You should still plot them in Sage or Wolfram-Alpha, but don't worry about sketching a plot (unless you want to).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{x3dcurl}
Compute the curl for each of the following vector fields. You can add these in the spaces after \hyperref[x3d_div]{Exercise~2}.%

\end{itemize}

\par
As a final application of surface integrals, we now generalize the circulation version of Green's theorem to surfaces. With the curl defined earlier, we are prepared to explain Stokes' Theorem.%
\par
Let's start by showing how Green's theorem extends to 3D. A vector field in the plane \(\vec F = \left(M,N\right)\) can be extended to 3D by writing \(\vec F = \left(M,N,0\right)\). The curl is \(\text{ curl } \vec F = \left\lt 0,0,N_x-M_y\right>\). A normal vector to a surface \(S\) in the \(xy\) plane is \(\vec n = \left\lt 0,0,1\right>\). We can then write Green's theorem as%
\begin{equation*}
\oint_C\vec F\cdot d\vec r = \oint_C Mdx+Ndy = \iint_S \text{ curl } \cdot \vec n d\sigma = \iint_R \left(N_x-M_y\right) dA,
\end{equation*}
where \(C\) is a simple closed curve in the plane and \(S=R\) is the planar region that is inside \(C\).%
\begin{theorem}[{Stokes' Theorem}]\label{theorem-14}
Suppose \(\vec F(x,y,z) = (M,N,P)\). Suppose that \(S\) is a surface in the plane, whose boundary is the simple closed curve \(C\). Suppose that \(\vec n\) is a continuous unit normal vector to \(S\) along the entire surface, where the orientation of \(\vec n\) matches the orientation of \(C\) according to the right hand rule (meaning that if you curl your right hand around \(\vec n\) with your thumb pointing along \(\vec n\), then your fingers will follow the orientation of \(\vec C\)). Then Stokes' theorem states that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_C\vec F\cdot d\vec r = \iint_S \text{ curl } \cdot \vec n d\sigma .
\end{equation*}
%
\end{theorem}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-290}
Consider the vector field \(\vec F = (2z,3y,-4x)\). Let \(C\) be the disc \(x^2+z^2\leq 9\) in the plane \(y=2\). Let \(C\) be the boundary of this disc, so the circle \(x^2+z^2=9\) in the plane \(y=2\). The curve \(C\) is oriented in the counterclockwise direction when looked at from the origin.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-802} Compute the curl of \(\vec F\), and state the unit normal vector \(\vec n\) to \(S\) that is oriented compatibly with \(C\).%
\item\label{task-803} Give a parametrization \(\vec r(t)\) of the curve \(C\).%
\item\label{task-804} Verify Stokes' theorem by computing both sides of the equation:%
\begin{equation*}
\int_C\vec F\cdot d\vec r = \iint_S \text{ curl } \cdot \vec n d\sigma.
\end{equation*}
The left side will require you to set up and evaluate a line integral.  The right side will require you to evaluate a surface integral (though you should be able to reduce this integral to a known quantity).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-291}
Consider the vector field \(\vec F = \left(x+y, y+z, x+z\right)\).%
\par
Let \(C\) be the space curve which travels around a triangle in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) and hits the vertexes \((2,0,0)\), \((0,3,0)\), and \((0,0,6)\), in this order. This triangle lies in the plane \(S\) given by \(\ds \frac x2+\frac y3 +\frac z6=1\), or equivalently \(z=6-3x-2y\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-805} Give bounds for \(x\) and \(y\) so that \(\vec r(x,y)=(x,y,6-3x-2y)\) is a parametrization of \(S\).%
\item\label{task-806} Show that the circulation of \(\vec F\) along \(C\) is \(-18\), by using Stokes' theorem.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-292}
Let \(\vec F = \left\lt z,y^2,x^2\right>\). The surface \(S\), parametrized by \(\vec r(u,v) = \left\lt u\cos v,u\sin v, u\right>\) for \(0\leq u\leq 1\) and \(0\leq v\leq 2\pi\) is a cone. The boundary of \(S\) is the curve \(C\) is a circle of radius one at height \(z=1\). If we choose as our normal vector to \(S\) the outward normal (away from the \(z\)-axis), then to use Stokes' theorem we must orient \(C\) counterclockwise as seen from below the surface.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-807} Find \(\vec n d\sigma\) (the product should allow you to ignore magnitudes).%
\item\label{task-808} Give a parameterization of \(C\) that is oriented compatibly with \(\vec n\).%
\item\label{task-809} Set up both integrals in Stokes' theorem. Don't evaluate either.%
\item\label{task-810} Note that the surface \(S_2\), which is the disc \(x^2+y^2\leq 1\) at height \(z=1\), has the same boundary \(C\) as surface \(S\). The normal vectors to \(S_2\) are \((0,0,\pm 1)\). Use Stokes' theorem to compute both integrals above.%
\end{enumerate}
\bigbreak
Being creative in your choice of surface can sometimes make a problem trivial.%
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-293}
Let \(\vec F(x,y,z)=(M,N,P)\) be a continuously differentiable vector field. Suppose that \(\vec F\) has a potential (so that \(D\vec F\) is symmetric).%

After completing this section you will: \leavevmode%

\item{}Be comfortable setting up triple integrals for a solid region (domain)%
\item{}Be able to switch the order of integration for a triple integral%
\end{itemize}

Consider the iterated integral%
\begin{equation*}
\ds \int_{-3}^3 \int_0^{\sqrt{9-y^2}}\int_0^{9-x^2-y^2} 1dzdxdy.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
This is an integral of the form \(\iiint_D dV\), which means along some solid region \(D\) in the plane, we are adding up little bits of volume. This integral will give the volume of a very familiar solid region in space. Not every triple integral will correspond to an easily drawn or visualized (even with a computer) space. However, this one does.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-294}
Before we compute this integral, let's visualize it. The parenthesis have been added to help you parse this first example.%
\begin{equation*}
\ds \int_{-3}^3 (\int_0^{\sqrt{9-y^2}} (\int_0^{9-x^2-y^2} 1dz) dx ) dy.
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-815} State the bounds for each variable as inequalities.%
\item\label{task-816} Sketch the region \(D\) in space.%
\item\label{task-817} Compute the innermost integral, and compare the resulting/remaining double integral to the first exercise in the double integral unit.%
\item\label{task-818} Now evaluate the remaining integrals (though you might want to change coordinate systems before doing so).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
When working with double integrals, there were two different ways to set up the bounds for our integrals, as \(dA=dxdy=dydx\). When working with triple integrals, there are six different ways to order the differentials, and therefore set up bounds for our integrals.%
\begin{equation*}
dV=dxdydz = dxdzdy = dydxdz=dydzdx=dzdxdy=dzdydx
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Consider again the iterated integral%
\begin{equation*}
\ds \int_{-3}^3 \int_0^{\sqrt{9-y^2}}\int_0^{9-x^2-y^2} dzdxdy = \int_0^9\int_0^{\sqrt{9-z}}\int_{-\sqrt{9-x^2-z}}^{\sqrt{9-x^2-z}} dydxdz
\end{equation*}
%
\par
These two integrals are equal, but required switching the order of the bounds. There are 4 other iterated integrals that are equal to these integral which can also be found by switching the order of the bounds.%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-295}
Set up the equivalent integrals using the differential orderings: \(dydzdx\) and \(dxdzdy\). We'll look at the remaining 2 in class (though you're welcome to finish them and present them with your work).%
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-296}
Consider the iterated integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-1}^1\int_0^{1-x^2}\int_0^{y} dzdydx.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The bounds for this integral describe a region in space which satisfies the 3 inequalities \(-1\leq x\leq 1\), \(0\leq y\leq 1-x^2\), and \(0\leq z\leq y\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

We'll create the other 3 in class (though you are welcome to include them as part of your presentation)%
\end{exploration}

In each exercise below, you'll be given enough information to determine a solid domain \(D\) in space.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-822} Draw the solid \(D\) and%
\item\label{task-823} then set up an iterated integral (pick any order you want) that would give the volume of \(D\).%
\item\label{task-824} The region \(D\) under the surface \(z=y^2\), above the \(xy\)-plane, and bounded by the planes \(y=-1\), \(y=1\), \(x=0\), and \(x=4\).%

\item\label{task-827} The region \(D\) that is inside both right circular cylinders \(x^2+z^2=1\) and \(y^2+z^2=1\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
We can find average value, centroids, centers of mass, moments of inertia, and radii of gyration exactly as before. We just now need to integrate using three integrals, and replace \(ds\), \(dA\) or \(d\sigma\), with \(dV\).%
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-298}
Consider the triangular wedge \(D\) that is in the first octant, bounded by the planes \(\ds\frac{y}{7}+\frac{z}{5}=1\) and \(x=12\). In the \(yz\) plane, the wedge forms a triangle that passes through the points \((0,0,0)\), \((0,7,0)\), and \((0,0,5)\).%
It may help to sketch a picture first%

Just as we did with polar coordinates in two dimensions, we can compute a Jacobian for any change of coordinates in three dimensions. We will focus on cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems.%

Remember that the Jacobian of a transformation is found by first taking the derivative of the transformation, then finding the determinant, and finally computing the absolute value.%

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Use the Divergence Theorem to compute flux across a surface%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
In the double integral chapter, we learned a way to greatly simplify flux computations when working with simple closed curves. Green's theorem stated that \(\int_C \vec F\cdot \vec n\ ds = \iint_R (M_x+N_y) dA\). The divergence of \(\vec F\) is the quantity \(\text{ div } (\vec F) = M_x+N_y\). We saw this in \hyperref[definition_of_flux_density_in_2D]{definition~\ref{definition_of_flux_density_in_2D}} on \hyperref[definition_of_flux_density_in_2D]{page~\ref{definition_of_flux_density_in_2D}}, when we defined the divergence, or flux density, of a vector field \(\vec F\) at a point \(P\) to be the flux per unit area. We then stated that \(\text{ div } (\vec F)=M_x+N_y\). We more generally defined the divergence in the previous unit. This generalizes the simplification to higher dimensions, and is called the divergence theorem. We'll repeat the definition of divergence, with its theorem, for reference.%
\begin{theorem}[{Divergence Theorem}]\label{theorem-15}
Let \(S\) be a closed surface whose interior is the solid domain \(D\). Let \(\vec n\) be an outward pointing unit normal vector to \(S\). Suppose that \(\vec F(x,y,z)\) is a continuously differentiable vector field on some open region that contains \(D\). Then the outward flux of \(\vec F\) across \(S\) can be computed by adding up, along the entire solid \(D\), the flux per unit volume (divergence). Symbolically, the divergence theorem states%
\begin{equation*}
\iint_S\vec F\cdot \vec n d\sigma =  \iiint_D \vec \nabla \cdot \vec F dV = \iiint_D \left(M_x+N_y+P_z\right) dV
\end{equation*}
for \(S\) a closed surface with interior \(D\) and outward normal \(\vec n\).%
\end{theorem}
\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-308}
Consider the exact same vector field and box as \hyperref[boxflux]{Exercise~\ref{boxflux}}. We then have the vector field \(\vec F=(x+y,y,z)\) and \(S\) is the surface of the cube in the first quadrant bounded by {\(x=2,y=3,z=5\)}.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

Let \(S\) be the surface of the wedge in the first octant bounded by the planes \(x=1\) and \(\ds\frac{y}{2}+\frac{z}{3}=1\). Let \(\vec F\) be the vector field \(\left\lt x+3y^2,y^2-4x,2z+xy\right>\). Use the divergence theorem to compute the outward flux of \(\vec F\) across \(S\). Make sure you draw the wedge (you may find centroids and volume help complete this exercise rapidly).%

\begin{exploration}[]\label{exploration-310}
Consider the vector field \(\vec F = \left\lt yz,-xz,3xz\right>\). Let \(D\) be the solid region in space inside the cylinder of radius 4, above the plane \(z=0\), and below the paraboloid \(z=x^2+y^2\). The surface \(S\) consists of 3 portions, so computing the flux would require a rather time consuming process of parameterizing these 3 surfaces. Instead, use the divergence theorem to compute the outward flux of \(\vec F\) across the surface \(S\).%
