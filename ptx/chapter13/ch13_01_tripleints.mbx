    <introduction>

        After completing this section you will:

    </introduction>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Be comfortable setting up triple integrals for a solid region (domain)
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>

          Be able to switch the order of integration for a triple integral

    </ul>
  </objectives>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Consider the iterated integral
      <me>
        \ds \int_{-3}^3 \int_0^{\sqrt{9-y^2}}\int_0^{9-x^2-y^2} 1dzdxdy.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an integral of the form <m>\iiint_D dV</m>, which means along some solid region <m>D</m> in the plane, we are adding up little bits of volume. This integral will give the volume of a very familiar solid region in space. Not every triple integral will correspond to an easily drawn or visualized (even with a computer) space. However, this one does.
    </p>

    <exploration>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Before we compute this integral, let's visualize it. The parenthesis have been added to help you parse this first example.
          <me>
            \ds \int_{-3}^3 (\int_0^{\sqrt{9-y^2}} (\int_0^{9-x^2-y^2} 1dz) dx ) dy.
          </me>
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <p>
          State the bounds for each variable as inequalities.

      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          Sketch the region <m>D</m> in space.
        </p>
      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          Compute the innermost integral, and compare the resulting/remaining double integral to the first exercise in the double integral unit.
        </p>
      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          Now evaluate the remaining integrals (though you might want to change coordinate systems before doing so).
        </p>
      </task>
    </exploration>

    <p>
      When working with double integrals, there were two different ways to set up the bounds for our integrals, as <m>dA=dxdy=dydx</m>. When working with triple integrals, there are six different ways to order the differentials, and therefore set up bounds for our integrals.
      <me>
        dV=dxdydz = dxdzdy = dydxdz=dydzdx=dzdxdy=dzdydx
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider again the iterated integral
      <me>
        \ds \int_{-3}^3 \int_0^{\sqrt{9-y^2}}\int_0^{9-x^2-y^2} dzdxdy = \int_0^9\int_0^{\sqrt{9-z}}\int_{-\sqrt{9-x^2-z}}^{\sqrt{9-x^2-z}} dydxdz
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      These two integrals are equal, but required switching the order of the bounds. There are 4 other iterated integrals that are equal to these integral which can also be found by switching the order of the bounds.
    </p>

    <exploration>
      <p>
        Set up the equivalent integrals using the differential orderings: <m>dydzdx</m> and <m>dxdzdy</m>. We'll look at the remaining 2 in class (though you're welcome to finish them and present them with your work).
      </p>
    </exploration>

    <exploration>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Consider the iterated integral
          <me>
            \int_{-1}^1\int_0^{1-x^2}\int_0^{y} dzdydx.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          The bounds for this integral describe a region in space which satisfies the 3 inequalities <m>-1\leq x\leq 1</m>, <m>0\leq y\leq 1-x^2</m>, and <m>0\leq z\leq y</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Draw the solid domain <m>D</m> in space described by the bounds of the iterated integral.

            There are 5 other iterated integrals equivalent to this one.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In each exercise below, you'll be given enough information to determine a solid domain <m>D</m> in space.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Draw the solid <m>D</m> and
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Set up an iterated integral (pick any order you want) that would give the volume of <m>D</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: You don't need to evaluate the integral, rather you just need to set them up.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>

          The region <m>D</m> under the surface <m>z=y^2</m>, above the <m>xy</m>-plane, and bounded by the planes <m>y=-1</m>, <m>y=1</m>, <m>x=0</m>, and <m>x=4</m>.

    <p>
      We can find average value, centroids, centers of mass, moments of inertia, and  radii of gyration exactly as before. We just now need to integrate using three integrals, and replace <m>ds</m>, <m>dA</m> or <m>d\sigma</m>, with <m>dV</m>.

            It may help to sketch a picture first
