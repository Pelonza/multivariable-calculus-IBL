  <introduction>
    <p>
      In first-semester calculus, we learned how to compute integrals of the form <m>\int_a^b f dx</m> along straight (flat) segments <m>[a,b]</m>. This semester, in the line integral unit, we learned how to change the segment to a curve, which allowed us to compute integrals of the form <m>\int_C fds</m> along any curve <m>C</m>, instead of just along curves (segments) on the <m>x</m>-axis.
    </p>

    <p>
      The integral <m>\int_a^b dx=b-a</m> gives the length of the segment <m>[a,b]</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The integral <m>\int_C ds</m> gives the length <m>s</m> of the curve <m>C</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the double integral unit we learned how to compute double integrals <m>\iint_R fdA</m> along flat regions <m>R</m> in the plane. In this unit we will now learn how to change the flat region <m>R</m> into a curved surface <m>S</m>, and then compute integrals of the form <m>\iint_S fd\sigma</m> along curved surfaces. The differential <m>d\sigma</m> stands for a little bit of surface area. We already know that <m>\iint_R dA</m> gives the area of <m>R</m>. We'll define <m>\iint_S d\sigma</m> so that it gives the surface area of <m>S</m>.
    </p>

    <exploration>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Consider the surface <m>S</m> given by <m>z=9-x^2-y^2</m> (we've seen this surface many times). A parametrization of this surface is
          <me>
            \vec r(x,y) = (x,y,9-x^2-y^2).
          </me>
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <p>
          Draw the surface <m>S</m>.
        </p>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Add to your surface plot the parabolas given by <m>\vec r(x,0)</m>, <m>\vec r(x,1)</m>, and <m>\vec r(x,2)</m>, as well as the parabolas given by <m>\vec r(0,y)</m>, <m>\vec r(1,y)</m>, and <m>\vec r(2,y)</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            You should have an upside down paraboloid, with at least 6 different parabolas drawn on the surface. These parabolas should divide the surface up into a bunch of different patches.      
          </p>

      </task>
      <task>
        <introduction>
          <p>
            The previous task should end up with a surface in many patches. Our goal is to find the area of each patch, where each patch is almost like a parallelogram.
          </p>
        </introduction>
        <task>
          <p>
            Find <m>\ds \frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial x}</m> and <m>\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial y}</m>.

        <task>
          <p>
            These vectors form the edges of a parallelogram. Add that parallelogram to your picture.
          </p>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Show that the area of a parallelogram whose edges are the vectors <m>\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial x}(x,y)</m> and <m>\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial y}</m> is <m>\sqrt{1+4x^2+4y^2}</m>.

              What was one part of the definition/meanings for the cross product.

        </task>
        <task>
          <p>
            Find the area of the parallelogram whose edges are the vectors <m>\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial x}dx</m> and <m>\ds\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial y}dy</m>, where <m>dx</m> and <m>dy</m> are not yet determined.
          </p>
        </task>
      </task>
    </exploration>

    <p>
      In the previous problem, you showed that the area of the parallelogram with edges given by <m>\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial x}dx</m> and <m>\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial y}dy</m> is
      <me>
        d\sigma =\left |\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial x} \times \frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial y}\right| dxdy.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This little bit of area approximates the area of a tiny patch on the surface. If we add all these areas up, we should obtain the surface area.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>S</m> be a surface. Let <m>\vec r(u,v)=(x,y,z)</m> be a parametrization of the surface, where the bounds on <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> form a region <m>R</m> in the <m>uv</m> plane. Then the surface area element (representing a little bit of surface) is
          <me>
            d\sigma =\left |\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial v}\right| dudv = \left|\vec r_u\times\vec r_v\right|dudv.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          The surface integral of a continuous function <m>f(x,y,z)</m> along the surface <m>S</m> is
          <me>
            \iint_S f(x,y,z) d\sigma = \iint_R f(\vec r(u,v)) \left |\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial v}\right| dudv.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          If we let <m>f=1</m>, then the surface area of <m>S</m> is simply
          <me>
            \sigma = \iint_S d\sigma = \iint_R \left |\frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \vec r}{\partial v}\right| dudv.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      This definition tells us how to compute any surface integral. The steps are almost identical to the line integral steps.

        <li>
          <p>
            Multiply <m>f</m> by <m>d\sigma</m>, and replace each <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m> with what they equals from the parametrization.
          </p>

    </objectives>

    <p>
      We now want to look at the flux of a vector field across a surface <m>S</m>. In the line integral section, we defined the outward flux of a vector field <m>F</m> across a curve <m>C</m> to be the line integral <m>\ds \int_C \vec F\cdot \vec n ds</m>, where <m>\vec n</m> is a normal vector point out of region enclosed by a curve <m>C</m>. When we want to find the flux of a vector field across a surface, we must state in which direction we want to compute the flux. We then must make sure that normal vector <m>\vec n</m> we choose to use actually points in the desired direction. The flux of a vector field <m>\vec F</m> across a surface <m>S</m> is the surface integral
      <me>
        \text{ Flux } =\Phi 
        = \iint_S \vec F\cdot \vec n d\sigma 
        .

      The next problem will help us simplify the computation of <m>\vec nd\sigma</m>.

      In the problem above, we showed that <m>\vec n d\sigma = \pm(\vec r_x\times\vec r_y)dxdy</m> and that <m>\vec n d\sigma = \pm(\vec r_r\times\vec r_\theta)drd\theta</m>. We no longer need to find the magnitude of the cross product, but we must determine the correct sign to put on our cross product. This shows us that we can write flux as
      <me>
        \text{ Flux } =\Phi 
        = \iint_S \vec F\cdot \vec n d\sigma

          Compute the normal vector and look at the third component to determine if it points up or down.

      When the surface is flat, often you can determine the normal vector without having to perform any cross products. We'll now compute a flux of a vector field outwards across the 6 faces of a cube.

    <exploration xml:id="boxflux">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the flux of <m>\vec F=(x+y,y,z)</m> outward across the surface of the cube in the first quadrant bounded by {<m>x=2,y=3,z=5</m>}. The cube has 6 surfaces, so we have to compute the flux across all 6 surfaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fill in the table below to write the flux integral across each surface, and then compute each integral and sum to find the total flux. You should be able to complete each integral by considering centroids and surface area of each of the 6 different flat surfaces.
