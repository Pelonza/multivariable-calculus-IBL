  <title>Circulation Density and Stokes' Theorem</title>
  <p>
    After completing this sectoin you should...
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Be able to apply Stokes' Theorem to evaluate work integrals over simple closed curves.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    As a final application of surface integrals, we now generalize the circulation version of Green's theorem to surfaces. With the curl defined earlier, we are prepared to explain Stokes' Theorem.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's start by showing how Green's theorem extends to 3D. A vector field in the plane <m>\vec F = \left(M,N\right)</m> can be extended to 3D by writing <m>\vec F = \left(M,N,0\right)</m>. The curl is <m>\text{ curl } \vec F = \left\lt 0,0,N_x-M_y\right></m>. A normal vector to a surface <m>S</m> in the <m>xy</m> plane is <m>\vec n = \left\lt 0,0,1\right></m>. We can then write Green's theorem as
    <me>
      \oint_C\vec F\cdot d\vec r = \oint_C Mdx+Ndy = \iint_S \text{ curl } \cdot \vec n d\sigma = \iint_R \left(N_x-M_y\right) dA,
    </me>
    where <m>C</m> is a simple closed curve in the plane and <m>S=R</m> is the planar region that is inside <m>C</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <title>Stokes' Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\vec F(x,y,z) = (M,N,P)</m>. Suppose that <m>S</m> is a surface in the plane, whose boundary is the simple closed curve <m>C</m>. Suppose that <m>\vec n</m> is a continuous unit normal vector to <m>S</m> along the entire surface, where the orientation of <m>\vec n</m> matches the orientation of <m>C</m> according to the right hand rule (meaning that if you curl your right hand around <m>\vec n</m> with your thumb pointing along <m>\vec n</m>, then your fingers will follow the orientation of <m>\vec C</m>). Then Stokes' theorem states that
        <me>
          \int_C\vec F\cdot d\vec r = \iint_S \text{ curl } \cdot \vec n d\sigma .
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <exploration>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the vector field <m>\vec F = (2z,3y,-4x)</m>. Let <m>C</m> be the disc <m>x^2+z^2\leq 9</m> in the plane <m>y=2</m>. Let <m>C</m> be the boundary of this disc, so the circle <m>x^2+z^2=9</m> in the plane <m>y=2</m>. The curve <m>C</m> is oriented in the counterclockwise direction when looked at from the origin.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <p>
        Compute the curl of <m>\vec F</m>, and state the unit normal vector <m>\vec n</m> to <m>S</m> that is oriented compatibly with <m>C</m>.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Give a parametrization <m>\vec r(t)</m> of the curve <m>C</m>.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Verify Stokes' theorem by computing both sides of the equation:
        <me>
          \int_C\vec F\cdot d\vec r = \iint_S \text{ curl } \cdot \vec n d\sigma.
        </me>
        The left side will require you to set up and evaluate a line integral.  The right side will require you to evaluate a surface integral (though you should be able to reduce this integral to a known quantity).

        Let <m>C</m> be the space curve which travels around a triangle in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> and hits the vertexes <m>(2,0,0)</m>, <m>(0,3,0)</m>, and <m>(0,0,6)</m>, in this order.
        This triangle lies in the plane <m>S</m> given by <m>\ds \frac x2+\frac y3 +\frac z6=1</m>, or equivalently <m>z=6-3x-2y</m>.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vec F = \left\lt z,y^2,x^2\right></m>. The surface <m>S</m>, parametrized by <m>\vec r(u,v) = \left\lt u\cos v,u\sin v, u\right></m> for <m>0\leq u\leq 1</m> and <m>0\leq v\leq 2\pi</m> is a cone. The boundary of <m>S</m> is the curve <m>C</m> is a circle of radius one at height <m>z=1</m>. If we choose as our normal vector to <m>S</m> the outward normal (away from the <m>z</m>-axis), then to use Stokes' theorem we must orient <m>C</m> counterclockwise as seen from below the surface.

        Give a parameterization of <m>C</m> that is oriented compatibly with <m>\vec n</m>.

        Set up both integrals in Stokes' theorem. Don't evaluate either.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Note that the surface <m>S_2</m>, which is the disc <m>x^2+y^2\leq 1</m> at height <m>z=1</m>, has the same boundary <m>C</m> as surface <m>S</m>. The normal vectors to <m>S_2</m> are <m>(0,0,\pm 1)</m>. Use Stokes' theorem to compute both integrals above.

      Being creative in your choice of surface can sometimes make a problem trivial.
