  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section we'll return to the concept of work. Many vector fields are actually the derivative of a function. When this occurs, computing work along a curve is extremely easy. All you have to know is the endpoints of the curve, and the function <m>f</m> whose derivative gives you the vector field. This function is called a potential for a vector field. Once we are comfortable finding potentials, we'll show that the work done by such a vector field is the difference in the potential at the end points. This makes finding work extremely fast.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>Gradients and Potentials</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\vec F</m> be a vector field. A potential for the vector field is a function <m>f</m> whose derivative equals <m>\vec F</m>. So if <m>Df=\vec F</m>, then we say that <m>f</m> is a potential for <m>\vec F</m>. When we want to emphasize that the derivative of <m>f</m> is a vector field, we call <m>Df</m> the gradient of <m>f</m> and write <m>Df = \vec \nabla f</m>. If <m>\vec F</m> has a potential, then we say that <m>\vec F</m> is a gradient field.
        </p>
        <aside>
          <p>
            The symbol <m>\vec \nabla f</m> is read <q>the gradient of <m>f</m></q> or <q>del f.</q>

    <p>
      We'll quickly see that if a vector field has a potential, then the work done by the vector field is the difference in the potential. If you've ever dealt with kinetic and potential energy, then you hopefully recall that the change in kinetic energy is precisely the difference in potential energy. This is the reason we use the word <q>potential.</q>

      Based on your observations in the previous exercise, we have the following key theorem.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_has_potential">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\vec F</m> be a vector field that is everywhere continuously differentiable. Then <m>\vec F</m> has a potential if and only if the derivative <m>D\vec F</m> is a symmetric matrix. We say that a matrix is symmetric if interchanging the rows and columns results in the same matrix (so if you replace row 1 with column 1, and row 2 with column 2, etc., then you obtain the same matrix).

    <p>
      If a vector field has a potential, then there is an extremely simple way to compute work. To see this, we must first review the fundamental theorem of calculus. The second half of the fundamental theorem of calculus states,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>F</m> is an anti-derivative of <m>f</m>, then <m>F(b)-F(a) = \int_a^b f(x) dx</m>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If we replace <m>f</m> with <m>f'</m>, then an anti-derivative of <m>f'</m> is <m>f</m>, and we can write,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        If <m>f</m> is continuously differentiable on <m>[a,b]</m>, then
        <me>
          f(b)-f(a)=\int_a^b f'(x) dx.
        </me>
      </p>

          Suppose <m>f</m> is a continuously differentiable function, defined along some open region containing the smooth curve <m>C</m>. Let <m>\vec r(t)</m> be a parametrization of the curve <m>C</m> for <m>t\in[a,b]</m>. Then we have
          <me>
            f(\vec r(b))-f(\vec r(a))=\int_a^b Df(\vec r(t))D\vec r(t)\ dt.

    </theorem>

    <p>
      Notice that if <m>\vec F</m> is a vector field, and has a potential <m>f</m>, which means <m>\vec F = Df</m>, then we could rephrase this theorem as follows.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\vec F</m> is a a vector field that is continuous along some open region containing the curve <m>C</m>. Suppose <m>\vec F</m> has a potential <m>f</m>. Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be the start and end points of the smooth curve <m>C</m>.  Then the work done by <m>\vec F</m> along <m>C</m> depends only on the start and end points, and is precisely
        <me>
          f(B)-f(A)=\int_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r = \int_C Mdx+Ndy.
        </me>
        The work done by <m>\vec F</m> is the difference in a potential.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If you are familiar with kinetic energy, then you should notice a key idea here. Work is a transfer of energy. As an object falls, energy is transferred from potential energy to kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy at the end of a fall is precisely equal to the difference between the potential energy at the top of the fall and the potential energy at the bottom of the fall (neglecting air resistance). So work (the transfer of energy) is exactly the difference in potential energy.

          We say that a vector field is conservative if the integral <m>\int_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r</m> does not depend on the path <m>C</m>. We say that a curve <m>C</m> is piecewise smooth if it can be broken up into finitely many smooth curves.

           Let <m>u=x^2+4</m>, which means <m>du=2xdx</m> or <m>dx=\frac{du}{2x}</m>.  This means:
          <me>
            \ds \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+4}}dx 
            = \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{u}}\frac{du}{2x} 
            = \frac{1}{2}\int u^{-1/2}du
            = \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^{1/2}}{1/2}
            = \sqrt{u} = \sqrt{x^2+4}.

          The gravitational vector field is directly related to the radial field <m>\ds\vec F = \frac{\left(-x,-y,-z\right)}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}}</m>. Show that this vector field is conservative, by finding a potential for <m>\vec F</m>. Then compute the work done by an object that moves from <m>(1,2,-2)</m> to <m>(0,-3,4)</m> along ANY path that avoids the origin.

        Suppose <m>\vec F</m> is a gradient field. Let <m>C</m> be a <em>piecewise smooth closed curve</em>. Compute <m>\int_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r</m> (you should get a number). Explain how you know your answer is correct.
