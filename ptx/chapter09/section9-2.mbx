    In first semester calculus, we learned that the area under a function <m>f(x)</m> above the <m>x</m>-axis is given by <m>A = \int_a^b f(x) dx</m>. The quantity <m>dA= f(x) dx</m> represents a small bit of area whose length is <m>dx</m> and whose height is <m>f(x)</m>. To get the total area, we just added up the little bits of area, which is why
    <me>
      A=\int dA = \int_a^b f(x) dx.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the surface in space that is below the function
        <m>f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2</m> and above the curve <m>C</m> parametrized by
        <m>\vec r(t)=(2\cos t, 3\sin t)</m> for <m>t\in[0,2\pi]</m>. Think of this region as a metal plate that has been stood up with its base on <m>C</m> where the height above each spot is given by <m>z=f(x,y)</m>.

    Our results from the exercise above suggest the following definition.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <title>Line Integral</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m> be a function and let <m>C</m> be a piecewise smooth curve whose parametrization is <m>\vec r(t)</m> for <m>t\in[a,b]</m>. We'll require that the composition <m>f(\vec r(t))</m> be continuous for all <m>t\in [a,b]</m>. Then we define the line integral
        of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> to be the integral
        <me>
          \int_C f ds 
          = \int_a^b f(\vec r(t))\frac{ds}{dt}dt
          = \int_a^b f(\vec r(t))\left|\frac{d\vec r}{dt}\right|dt.
        </me>
      </p>
<aside>
  <p> 
    The line integral is also called the path integral, contour integral, or curve integral.
  </p>
</aside>

    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Notice that this definition suggests the following four steps. These four steps are the key to computing any line integral. 
<aside>
  <p> 
    When we ask you to set up a line integral, it means that you should do steps 1<ndash />3, so that you get an integral with a single variable and with bounds that you could plug into a computer or complete by hand.

          Start by getting a parametrization <m>\vec r(t)</m> for <m>a\leq t\leq b</m> of the curve <m>C</m>.
        </p>


      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Find the speed by computing the velocity <m>\dfrac{d\vec r}{dt}</m> and then the speed <m>\left|\dfrac{d\vec r}{dt}\right|</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Multiply <m>f</m> by the speed, and replace each <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and/or <m>z</m> with what it equals in terms of <m>t</m>.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          Integrate the product from the previous step. Practice doing this by hand on every exercise, unless it specifically says to use technology. Some of the integrals are impossible to do by hand.

    Work, flow, circulation, and flux are all examples of line integrals. Remember that work, flow, and circulation are
    <me>
      W=\int_C (\vec F\cdot \vec T)ds =\int_C (M,N)\cdot(dx,dy) =  \int_C Mdx+Ndy,
    </me>
    while the formula for flux is
    <me>
      \Phi=\int_C (\vec F\cdot \vec n)ds =\int_C (M,N)\cdot(dy,-dx) =  \int_C Mdy+Ndx.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Do you see how these are both the line integral of a function <m>f = \vec F\cdot \vec T</m> or <m>f=\vec F\cdot \vec n</m> along a curve <m>C</m>. The function <m>f</m> inside the integrand does not have to represent the height of a sheet. We'll use it to represent lots of things. Let's practice two more work/flux exercises, to sharpen our skills with these concepts.

        Let <m>\vec F=(-y,x+y)</m> and <m>C</m> be the triangle with vertices <m>(2,0)</m>, <m>(0,2)</m>, and <m>(0,0)</m>.

      <p>
        Look at a drawing of <m>C</m> and the vector field (see margin for the Sage link).  We'll move along the triangle in a counter clockwise manner. Without doing any computations, for each side of the triangle make a guess to determine if the flow along that edge is positive, negative, or zero. Similarly, guess the sign of the flux along each edge.  Explain.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Obtain three parametrizations for the triangle, one for each edge.  One of the parametrizations is <m>\vec r(t) = (0,-2)t+(0,2)</m>.

    <task>
      <p>
        Now find the counterclockwise circulation (work) done by <m>\vec F</m> along <m>C</m>.  You'll have three separate calculations, one for each side. We'll do the flux computation in class.

  <p>
    Ask me in class to change the vector fields above, and examine what happens with different vectors fields. In particular, it's possible to have any combination of values for circulation and flux. We'll be able to use technology to rapidly compute many values.
