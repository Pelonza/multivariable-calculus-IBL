    Now that we can describe motion, let's turn our attention to the work done by a vector field as we move through the field. Work is a transfer of energy.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A tornado picks might pick up a couch, and applies forces to the couch as the couch swirls around the center. Work transfers the energy from the tornado to then couch, giving the cough it's kinetic energy.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          When an object falls, gravity does work on the object. The work done by gravity converts potential energy to kinetic energy.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          If we consider the flow of water down a river, it's gravity that gives the water its kinetic energy. We can place a hydro electric dam next to river to capture a lot of this kinetic energy.  Work transfers the kinetic energy of the river to rotational energy of the turbine, which eventually ends up as electrical energy available in our homes.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    When we study work, we are really studying how energy is transferred. This is one of the key components of modern life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's start with simple review. Recall that the work done by a vector field <m>\vec F</m> through a displacement <m>\vec d</m> is the dot product <m>\vec F\cdot \vec d</m>. We saw this in <xref ref="first_work_problem"/>.
  </p>

  <p>
    An object moves from <m>A=(6,0)</m> to <m>B=(0,3)</m>. Along the way, it encounters the constant force <m>\vec F = (2,5)</m>. How much work is done by <m>\vec F</m> as the object moves from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>? See<fn>The displacement is <m>B-A=(-6,3)</m>. The work is <m>\vec F\cdot \vec d = (2,5)\cdot(-6,3) = -12+15=3</m>.</fn>.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        An object moves from <m>A=(6,0)</m> to <m>B=(0,3)</m>. A parametrization of the objects path is <m>\vec r(t) = (-6,3)t+(6,0)</m> for <m>0\leq t\leq 1</m>. We are going to investigate what happens under a non-constant force.
      </p>

        For <m>0\leq t\leq .5</m>, what is the displacement vector <m>\vec{d}</m> from <m>\vec{r}(0) \rightarrow \vec{r}(0.5)</m>?

        If the force encountered over this section is <m>\vec F = (2,5)</m> how much work is done?

        If the force encountered over this section is <m>\vec F = (2,6)</m> how much work is done?

        You can visualize what's happening in this exercise as follows.  Attach a clothesline between the points (maybe representing two trees in your backyard).  Put a cub scout space derby ship on the clothesline.  Then the wind starts to blow.  As the ship moves along the clothesline, the wind changes direction.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Suppose that the force constantly changes as we move along the curve. At <m>t</m>, we'll assume we encountered the force <m>F(t) = (2,5+2t)</m>.

        Find <m>\ds W=\int \vec F\cdot d\vec r = \int_0^{0.5} (2,5+2t)\cdot (-6,3)dt.</m>

  <p>
    We know how to compute work when we move along a straight line. Prior to <xref ref="first_work_problem"/> on <xref ref="first_work_problem">page</xref>, we made the following statements.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  If a force <m>F</m> acts through a displacement <m>d</m>, then the most basic definition of work is <m>W=Fd</m>, the product of the force and the displacement.  This basic definition has a few assumptions.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The force <m>F</m> must act in the same direction as the displacement.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        The force <m>F</m> must be constant throughout the  displacement.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        The displacement must be in a straight line.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    We used the dot product to remove the first assumption, and we showed in <xref ref="first_work_problem"/> that the work is simply the dot product
    <me>
      W=\vec F\cdot \vec r,
    </me>
    where <m>\vec F</m> is a force acting through a displacement <m>\vec r</m>. The previous exercise showed that we can remove the assumption that <m>\vec F</m> is constant, by integrating to obtain
    <me>
      W=\int \vec F \cdot d\vec r = \int_a^b F\cdot \frac{d\vec r}{dt}dt,
    </me>
    provided we have a parametrization of <m>\vec r</m> with <m>a\leq t\leq b</m>. The next exercise gets rid of the assumption that <m>\vec r</m> is a straight line.

        Optional (we'll discuss this in class if you don't have it).  How much work does it take to go along the closed path that starts at <m>(2,0)</m>, follows the parabola <m>y=4-x^2</m> to <m>(-3,1)</m>, and then returns to <m>(2,0)</m> along a straight line.

    The examples above showed us that we can compute work along any closed curve. All we have to do is parametrize the curve, take a derivative, and then compute <m>dW = \vec F \cdot d\vec r</m>. This gives us a little bit of work along a curve, and we sum up the little bits of work (integrate) to find the total work.

      In the exercises for the previous sections, the vector fields represented forces. However, vector fields can represent much more than just forces. The vector field might represent the flow of water down a river, or the flow of air across an airplane wing. When we think of the vector field as a velocity field, then we mights ask the question, how much of the fluid flows along our curve. Alternately, we might ask how much of the fluid flows across our curve. These two exercises lead to flow along a curve, and flux across a curve. Flow along a curve is directly related to the lift of an airplane wing (which occurs when the flow along the top of the wing is different than the flow below the wing). The flux across a curve will quickly take us to powering a wind mill as wind flows across the surface of a blade (once we hit 3D integrals).

        When you construct a plot of this vector field, you should notice that it causes objects to spin outwards in the clockwise direction. Suppose an object moves counterclockwise around a circle <m>C</m> of radius 3 that is centered at the origin. (You'll need to parametrize the curve.)
