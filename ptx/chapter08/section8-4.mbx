    The unit tangent vector <m>\vec T</m> provides us with a unit vector in the direction of motion. We can obtain the direction of motion from the velocity. If we stay on a straight course, then our acceleration is in the same direction as our motion, and would only cause us to speed up or slow down. We'll call this tangential acceleration.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we want to design a roller coaster, build an F15 fighter plane, send a satellite in orbit, or construct anything that doesn't move in a straight line, we need to understand how acceleration causes us to leave a straight path. We may still be speeding up or slowing down (tangential acceleration), but now we'll have a component that veers us off the straight path. We'll call this normal acceleration, it's orthogonal to the velocity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back in the vector chapter, we practiced writing a force <m>\vec F</m> as the sum of the component parallel to a displacement <m>\vec d</m> and the component orthogonal to <m>\vec d</m>. We could write this as <m>\vec F = \vec F_{|| \text{ to } \vec d} + \vec F_{\perp \text{ to } \vec d}.</m> The parallel part came from a projection. The orthogonal part came from vector subtraction. If you've forgotten how to do this, please do this review exercise.
  </p>

  <project>

  <p>
    Consider the force vector <m>\vec F = (0,-10)</m>, and displacement vector <m>\vec (2,-1)</m>. Compute the projection of <m>\vec F</m> onto <m>\vec d</m>, and then write <m>\vec F</m> as the sum of a vector parallel to <m>\vec d</m> and a vector orthogonal to <m>\vec d</m>. See<fn>The projection is <m>\proj_{\vec d}\vec F = \frac{10}{5}(2,-1) = (4,-2)</m>.  This is the parallel component <m>\vec F_{|| \text{ to } \vec d} =(4,-2)</m>.  To get the orthogonal component, we know that <m>\vec F = \vec F_{|| \text{ to } \vec d} + \vec F_{\perp \text{ to } \vec d}</m>. Vector subtraction gives
    <m>\vec F_{\perp \text{ to } \vec d} = \vec F -\vec F_{|| \text{ to } \vec d} = (0,-10)-(4,-2) = (-4,-8)</m>.
    We now write
    <me>
      \vec F = (4,-2) + (-4,-8).
    </me></fn>.

    If we throw a pebble from a 64 ft tall cliff, then we could parameterize the path after <m>t</m> seconds using <m>\vec r(t) = (3t,64-16t^2)</m>. The numbers below get rather large in a hurry, so let's use a simpler parameterization to gain understanding about the connection between <m>\vec v</m>, <m>\vec a</m>, <m>\vec T</m>, and <m>\vec N</m>. Sometimes the key to understanding is to simplify the exercise.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the parameterization <m>\vec r(t) = (t,9-t^2)</m> (it's a simplified version of tossing a pebble off a building). Our goal, at time <m>t=1</m>, is to write <m>\vec a</m> in the form <m>\vec a = a_T\vec T+a_N\vec N.</m> Follow the steps below.

      <p>
        At <m>t=1</m>, compute the projection of <m>\vec a</m> onto <m>\vec T</m>, i.e. compute <m>\proj_{\vec T(1)}\vec a(1)</m>.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        State <m>\vec N(t)</m> (remember you can flip the order and change a sign), and then at <m>t=1</m> compute <m>\text{ proj } _{\vec N(1)}\vec a(1)</m>.

        Suppose that <m>\vec r(t)</m> is a smooth parametrization of a moving object. Let <m>\vec T</m> be the unit tangent vector. The tangential component of acceleration and the normal component of acceleration are the scalars <m>a_T</m> and <m>a_N</m> that we obtain by writing the acceleration as the sum of a vector parallel to <m>T</m> and a vector orthogonal to <m>\vec T</m>, i.e. the scalars that satisfy

    Let's return to the example of Sammy on a merry-go-round. From this example, we'll see one of the key ideas in this section.
  </p>

  <exploration>
    <title>Optional, we already basically did this</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Suppose that Sammy sits <m>\rho</m> feet away from the center of the merry-go-ground. His sister decides to spin him around at different speeds. Let <m>\vec r(t) = (\rho \cos \omega t, \rho \sin \omega t)</m> be a parametrization of Sammy's postion.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <p>
        Show that Sammy's speed is <m>|\vec v|=\rho \omega</m>.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Find the curvature of Sammy's path at any time <m>t</m> (it happens to be constant - and we did this already when we computed the curvature along a circle).
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Find the acceleration vector, and show that <m>\ds |\vec a| = \kappa |\vec v|^2 = \frac{|\vec v|^2}{\rho}</m>.
      </p>
    </task>
  </exploration>

  <p>
    In the exercise above, all of the acceleration is in the normal direction. The interesting thing to note is that the normal acceleration is ALWAY <m>a_N =  \frac{|\vec v|^2}{\rho}=\kappa |\vec v|^2</m>. That's what we'll now show.
    We'll show that the acceleration of an object moving along a curve <m>\vec r(t)</m> with velocity <m>\vec v(t)</m> is the sum
    <me>
      \vec a(t) = a_T\vec T+a_N\vec N=\frac{d}{dt}|\vec v(t)| \vec T + \kappa |\vec v|^2 \vec N.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    The scalars <m>a_T=\dfrac{d}{dt}|\vec v(t)|</m> and <m>a_N=\kappa |\vec v|^2</m>
    <!-- \extrafn{Engineers often use the equivalent formula <m>a_N = \frac{|\vec v|^2}{\rho}</m>, as <m>\rho</m> is a physical distance that they can measure.} -->are the tangential and normal components of acceleration. All we have to do is write the vector <m>\vec a(t)</m> as the sum of a vector parallel to <m>\vec T</m> and a vector orthogonal to <m>\vec T</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before we decompose the acceleration into its tangential and normal components, let's look at two examples to see what these facts physically represent.
  </p>

  <exploration>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Imagine that you are riding as a passenger on a road and encounter a series of switchbacks (so the road starts to zigzag up the mountain). Right before each bend in the road, you see a yellow sign that tells you a U-turn is coming up, and that you should reduce your speed from 45 mi/hr to 15 mi/hr. Assume the largest curvature along the turn is <m>\kappa</m>. Recall that <m>a_N=\kappa |\vec v|^2</m>. The engineers of the road designed the road so that if you are moving at 15 mi/hr, then the normal acceleration will be at most <m>A</m> units.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that your driver (Ben) ignores the suggestion to slow down to 15 mi/hr.  He keeps going 45 mi/hr through the turn. Had he slowed down, the max acceleration would be <m>A</m>.  You're traveling 3 times faster than suggested.  What will your maximum normal acceleration be?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          It's more than <m>3A</m>.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        You yell at Ben to slow down (you don't want to die). So Ben decides to only slow to 30 mi/hr. He figures this means you'll only feel twice as much acceleration as <m>A</m>.  Explain why this line of reasoning is flawed.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Ben gets frustrated by the fact that he has to slow down. He complains about the engineers who designed the road, and says, <q>they should have just built a larger corner so I could keep going 45.</q>  How much larger should the radius of the circle be so that you can travel 45 mi/hr instead of 15 mi/hr, and still feel the same acceleration <m>A</m>?
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Which will cause the normal acceleration to decrease more, halving your speed or halving the curvature (doubling the radius)?

        Prove that <m>\ds \vec a(t) = a_T\vec T+a_N\vec N=\frac{d}{dt}|\vec v| \vec T + \kappa |\vec v|^2 \vec N.</m> Here's some hints.

        Rewrite the velocity <m>\vec v</m> as a magnitude <m>|\vec v|</m> times a direction <m>\vec T</m>, so <m>\vec v = |v|\vec T</m>.

        We know that <m>\vec a(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\vec v(t)</m>. Take the derivative of <m>\vec v = |\vec v|\vec T</m> by using the product rule (on the scalar product <m>|\vec v|\vec T</m>).
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        You should encounter the quantity <m>d\vec T/dt</m>. We know that <m>\frac{d\vec T}{dt} = |\vec v|\frac{d\vec T}{ds}</m>. Why does <m>\ds d\vec T/dt=|\vec v|\kappa\vec N</m>?

      <p>
        Conclude to explain why <m>a_N =\kappa |\vec v|^2</m>.
      </p>
    </task>
  </exploration>

  <p>
    Let's now use the fact above to get an extremely useful formula for the curvature.
  </p>

  <exploration>
    <p>
      Show that
      <me>
        \kappa = \frac{|\vec v\times \vec a|}{|\vec v|^3} = \frac{|\vec r'\times \vec r''|}{|\vec r'|^3}.
      </me>
    </p>
    <hint>
      <p>
        We know that <m>\ds \vec a = a_T\vec T+a_N\vec N=\frac{d}{dt}|\vec v| \vec T + \kappa |\vec v|^2 \vec N.</m>
        Cross both sides with <m>\vec v</m>. You should be able to cancel <m>\vec v\times \vec v</m> (why). Then take the magnitude of each side and solve for <m>\kappa</m>. You'll have to explain why <m>|\vec v\times \vec N| = |\vec v|</m>.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </exploration>

  <p>
    We can use the above formula for curvature to get a quick way to compute the curvature of a function <m>y=f(x)</m>. If you use the previous exercise, this formula falls out almost instantly. You'd see this formula in dynamics

        , and it shows up on the Fundamentals of Engineering exam (where you just have to use the formula, not prove where it comes from)

          Let <m>\vec r(t)</m> be a parametrization of a smooth curve <m>C</m> with unit tangent vector <m>\vec T(t)</m>.
          The derivative of <m>\vec B</m> with respect to <m>s</m> tells us how rapidly the plane containing <m>\vec T</m> and <m>\vec N</m> rotates. We'll define the torsion vector to be
          
          <me>
            \vec \tau = \dfrac{d\vec B}{ds} = \dfrac{d\vec B/dt}{ds/dt}=\dfrac{d\vec B/dt}{|d\vec r/dt|}.

        <p>
          The torsion <m>\tau</m>, up to a sign, is the length of this vector. We say there is positive torsion if <m>\vec \tau</m> causes a counterclockwise rotation about <m>\vec T</m> (as you look down <m>\vec T</m>), which occurs precisely when <m>\vec tau</m> and <m>\vec N</m> point in opposite directions. We can summarize this is
          <me>
            \tau=\left|\dfrac{d\vec B}{ds}\right| \text{ or }  \tau=-\left|\dfrac{d\vec B}{ds}\right|,
          </me>
          where you choose <q><m>+</m></q> if <m>\vec N</m> and <m>\vec \tau</m> point in opposite directions.

    </definition>

    <p>
      The computations involved in getting <m>\tau</m> require a lot of work. Let's use the computer to help us. You can do all of this with the aid of Sage. I'll let you decide from the code what <m>\tau</m> is. That will be your decision to make.

      In the examples above, you should have noticed that <m>\vec \tau</m> was either parallel to <m>\vec N</m> or anti-parallel to <m>\vec N</m>. Let's now show this is always the case. The key is to use the product rule on the cross product, together with some key fact about the cross product.

          <em>Review Guide Creation</em>


          Your assignment: organize what you've learned into a small collection of examples that illustrates the key concepts. I'll call this your unit<nbsp />review guide. I'll provide you with a template which includes the unit's key concepts from the objectives at the beginning. Once you finish your review guide, scan it into a PDF document (use any scanner on campus or photo software) and upload it to Gradescope. <!-- \instructor{Gradescope is a cool grading platform! \url{www.gradescope.com} } --> 


          As you create this review guide, consider the following:

              <p>
                Before each Celebration of Knowledge <!-- \instructor{This is just an exam} --> we will devote a class period to review. With well created lesson plans, you will have 4-8 pages(for 2-4 Chapters) to review for each, instead of 50-100 problems.
