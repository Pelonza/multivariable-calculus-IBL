  <introduction>

    <p>
      The previous section developed a way to predict position and velocity from acceleration, let's look more in depth at the actual path taken by a projectile. We'll need to be able to compute the actual distance an object travels (not the displacement, but the distance). This requires that we study arc length. This was covered for curves in the plane in chapter's 3 and 4. (<xref ref="arc_length_formula">See</xref>)

      <statement>
        <p>
          A horse runs once around an elliptical track, which is parametrized by <m>\vec r(t) = (3\cos t,4\sin t)</m>. Set up, do not solve, an integral formula that tells us the distance the horse traveled. What's the displacement?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The velocity is <m>\vec v(t) = (3\sin t, -4\cos t)</m>. The speed is <m>v(t) = \sqrt{9\sin^2t+16\cos^2t}</m>. The distance traveled is the arc length <m>\ds s=\int_0^{2\pi} \left(\sqrt{9\sin^2t+16\cos^2t}\right)dt</m>. Since the horse's initial and final position are equal, the displacement is zero. Arc length does not equal displacement.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </project>

    <p>
      Let's now develop a formula for the arc length of a space curve, a curve in 3D. We can always parameterize a space curve with <m>\vec r(t) = (x,y,z)</m> (one input, 3 outputs).
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember: When we talk about speed and velocity it is importation to recognize their differences. Velocity has direction and (often components) while speed is the total movement or the magnitude of the velocity.

        <p>
          A space ship travels through the galaxy. Let <m>\vec r(t) = (x,y,z)</m>
          be the position of the space ship at time <m>t</m>, with the earth at the origin <m>(0,0,0)</m>.

          </p>

          <p>
            Technically, we should write <m>\vec r(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))</m>. However, we already know that <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> depend on <m>t</m>, hence we'll just leave the dependence on <m>t</m> off.

        <p>
          If the space ship travels for a really small time <m>dt</m>, then the speed is about constant. Since distance is speed times time, about how much distance (we'll call it <m>ds</m>) will the space ship travel in this short amount of time?

            s=\int_a^b |\vec r '(t)|\ dt = \int_a^b \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2}\ dt .

  <subsection>
    <title>Making 'Nice' Space-Curves</title>

    <p>
      In all our work that follows, we want to consider space curves that have nice smooth paths. What does this mean? We want to be able to compute tangent vectors at any point, so we will require that a parametrization <m>\vec r</m> be differentiable. However, this isn't enough.
    </p>

    <exploration>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          We've encountered the polar curve <m>r = 1-\sin\theta</m> before (we called it a cardioid, and it looked like heart). Recall that we can switch from polar to Cartesian using the coordinate transformation <m>x=r\cos\theta</m> and <m>y=r\sin\theta</m>.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <p>
          Draw the curve.
        </p>
      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          Give the parametrization of this curve: <m>\vec r(\theta) = ((1-\sin\theta)\cos\theta, ?)</m>.
        </p>
        <aside>
          <p>
            The parametrization is completely differentiable.
          </p>
        </aside>
      </task>

      <task>
        <p>
          Find <m>\dfrac{d\vec r}{d\theta}</m>.
        </p>
      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          You should notice a sharp cusp in the graph. At what <m>\theta</m> does this cusp occur?  What is the value of the derivative <m>\dfrac{d\vec r}{d\theta}</m> at this value of <m>\theta</m>.
        </p>
      </task>
    </exploration>

    <p>
      We'd like to avoid paths that contain a cusp, because at a cusp the direction of motion changes rather abruptly. This can happen physically, but it requires the speed of an object to reach zero, the object stops moving, and then the path changes direction. The fact that the speed reaches zero will mean we can't divide by it in our work that follows. To avoid this, we make a definition that requires the path is differentiable, and the velocity is never zero.
    </p>

      <title>Smooth Curves</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\vec r(t)=(x,y,z)</m> be a parametrization of a space curve <m>C</m>. We say that <m>\vec r</m> is smooth if <m>\vec r</m> is differentiable, and the derivative is never the zero vector. If <m>\vec r</m> is a smooth parameterization, then we call <m>C</m> a smooth curve.

    <p>
      In the previous exercise, you developed two big ideas. You showed how to obtain a unit tangent vector to a curve. You also developed a formula for the length of a curve from time <m>t=0</m> to any time <m>t=t</m>. This gives us a function <m>s(t)</m> that tells us how far we have traveled after <m>t</m> seconds. We can now predict distance traveled from time. Predicting the future is powerful. Before moving on, let's examine the derivative of <m>s(t)</m>, because it's a quantity we already know.

          Compute <m>\ds \int_0^t 3x^2 dx</m> and <m>\ds \int_0^t 3p^2 dp</m> and <m>\ds \int_0^t 3\tau^2 d\tau</m>.
          Does it matter what you call the variable inside the integral?
          Then compute <m>\ds\frac{d}{dt} \int_0^t 3\tau^2 d\tau</m>.

      <solution>
        <p>
          The first integral is <m>x^3|_0^t = t^3</m>. The other two are the same. You can change the variable inside the integral whenever you want.  For this reason, some people call it a dummy variable. 
          The last part is <m>\ds\frac{d}{dt} \int_0^t 3\tau^2 d\tau = \frac{d}{dt} t^3 = 3t^2</m>, 
          we just replaced <m>\tau</m> with <m>t</m> in <m>3\tau^2</m>.

          Let <m>\vec r(t)=(x,y,z)</m> be a parametrization of a smooth space curve. Let <m>\ds s(t)=\int_0^t \left|\frac {d\vec r}{d\tau} \right|\ d\tau</m>.

            You can remember <m>\ds\frac{ds}{dt} = \left|\frac {d\vec r}{dt} \right|</m> as follows. We use the differential <m>ds</m> to represents a change in distance, and <m>dt</m> represents a change in time.

      We'll call <m>\ds s(t)=\int_0^t \left|\frac {d\vec r}{d\tau}\right|\ d\tau</m> the arc length parameter. It tells us how far we've have traveled after <m>t</m> seconds. We can now predict distance traveled from time elapsed. Because <m>s(t)</m> is an increasing function, we can also invert this process and give time elapsed from distance traveled. This means we could compute derivatives with respect to <m>s</m> instead of <m>t</m>.
      When we take a derivative with respect to <m>s</m>, we ask how much a curve changes if we increase length by 1 unit, instead of increasing time by 1 unit. We'll write
      <me>
        \ds\frac{d\vec r}{ds} =\ds\frac{d\vec r/dt}{ds/dt} = \frac{d\vec r/dt}{|d\vec r/dt|} = \frac{\vec v}{|\vec{v}|}.

            \vec T = \ds\frac{d\vec r}{ds}=\ds\frac{d\vec r/dt}{ds/dt} = \frac{d\vec r/dt}{|d \vec r/dt|} = \frac{\vec v}{|\vec v|}.

      As we progress through this unit, one of our key goals is to learn new notation. We've got position <m>\vec r</m>, velocity <m>\vec v</m>, speed <m>v</m> or <m>ds/dt</m>, acceleration <m>\vec a</m>, the unit tangent vector <m>\vec T</m>, and the derivative of position with respect to arc length <m>d\vec r/ds</m>. The last two are the exact same since <m>\vec T = d\vec r/ds</m>. Did you also notice that <m>ds/dt</m> and <m>v</m> are both the speed? We'll need to start realizing that the same quantity can be developed in many ways.
