  <introduction>

    <p>
      Before we introduce multi-dimensional derivatives, let's recall the definition of a differential. If <m>y=f(x)</m> is a function, then we say the differential <m>dy</m> is the expression <m>dy=f'(x) dx</m>. We could also write this as <m>dy = \frac{dy}{dx}dx</m>. Similarly, if <m>w=g(t)</m> then we have the derivative as <m>\frac{dw}{dt}=g'(t)</m> and the differential as <m>dw=g'(t)dt</m>.
    </p>

    <observation>

    <p>
      Here's the key. Think of differential notation <m>dy=f'(x)dx</m> in the following way:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
      A change in the output <m>y</m> equals the derivative multiplied by  a change in the input <m>x</m>. To get <m>dy</m>, we just need the derivative times <m>dx</m>.
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      To get the derivative in all dimensions, we just substitute in vectors to obtain the differential notation <m>d\vec y = f'(\vec x) d\vec x</m>. The derivative is precisely the thing that tells us how to get <m>d\vec y</m> from <m>d\vec x</m>. We'll quickly see that <m>f'(\vec x)</m> must be a matrix, and then we'll start calling it <m>Df</m> instead of <m>f'</m>.
    </p>

      Let's now examine some exercises you have seen before.

      Part (d) in each exercise above is the KEY idea, let me repeat, THE KEY IDEA, to the rest of this course. It all goes back to differentials. We can compute a small change in volume, if we know how much the radius and height have changed, or if we know how much the length, width, and height will change.

      <xref ref="unit6_content"/> is precisely the content to this chapter. We just need to add some vocabulary to make it easier to talk about what we just did. Let's introduce the vocabulary in terms of the exercise above, and then make a formal definition.

            Some people call this the total derivative, as it's made up of two parts, called partial derivatives.

        <li>
          <p>
            The first column of this matrix is just part of the whole derivative. We can get the first column by holding <m>y</m> constant, and then differentiating with respect to <m>x</m>. This is precisely a partial derivative.  We'll write this as <m>\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xy+3</m>, or sometimes just <m>f_x = 2xy+3</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            The second column of the derivative is the partial of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>y</m>. We can get the second column by holding <m>x</m> constant, and then differentiating with respect to <m>y</m>. We'll write this as <m>\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x^2+20\cos(5y)</m>, or <m>f_y = x^2+20\cos(5y)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Remember, the derivative of <m>f</m> is a matrix. The columns of the matrix are the partial derivatives with respect to the input variables.

When there's more than one input variable, we'll use <m>Df</m> rather than <m>f'</m> to talk about derivatives.  The order of the columns must match the order you list the variables in the function. If the function is <m>f(x,y)</m>, then the derivative is

      Please take a moment and practice computing partial and total derivatives. Your textbook has lots of examples to help you with partial derivatives. However, the textbook leaves out the actual derivative. This <url href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Maw2KW9k9aYlBnN0p4Z3MyREk/view?usp=sharing">handwritten file (follow the link)</url> has 6 exercises, together with solutions, that you can use as extra practice for total derivatives.

      As you completed the exercises above, did you notice any connections between the size of the matrix and the size of the input and output vectors? Make sure you ask in class about this. We'll make a connection.

    <p>
      We've now seen that the derivative of <m>z=f(x,y)</m> is a matrix <m>Df(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}f_x \amp  f_y
      \end{bmatrix}</m>. This is a function itself that has inputs <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and outputs <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m>. This means it has 2 inputs and 2 outputs, so it's a vector field. What does the vector field tell us about the original function?

          Pick several points in the <m>xy</m> plane that lie on the level curves you already drew.  At these points, add the vector given by the derivative.  (So at (0,0), you'll need to draw the vector (0,1).  At (1,1), you'll need to draw the vector (-2,1).) Add 8 vectors to your picture, and then write down to share with the class any observations you make.

      We'll come back to this exercise more in chapter 9 as we discuss optimization. There are lots of connections between the derivative and level curves.

    <title>A Geometric Interpretation of the Derivative</title>
    <p>
      Let's now explain geometrically what a partial derivative is. The next few exercises will help with this.
    </p>

    <exploration>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Consider the change of coordinates <m>\vec T(r,\theta) = (r\cos \theta, r\sin \theta)</m>.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <p>
          Compute the partial derivatives <m>\ds\frac{\partial \vec T}{\partial r}</m> and <m>\ds\frac{\partial \vec T}{\partial \theta}</m>
        </p>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            State the derivative <m>D\vec T(r,\theta)</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            If you get a 2 by 2 matrix, then you're on the right track. Each partial derivative is a vector. (This one is in the <url href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Maw2KW9k9aYlBnN0p4Z3MyREk/view?usp=sharing">handwritten file</url> with extra practice.)

        <introduction>
          <p>
            Consider the polar point <m>(r,\theta) = (4,\pi/2)</m>.
          </p>

          </statement>
          <hint>
            <p>
              You should get a point and two vectors.
            </p>
          </hint>
        </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          At the point, draw both vectors.
        </p>
      </task>
      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          If you were standing at the polar point <m>(4,\pi/2)</m> and someone said, <q>Hey you, keep your angle constant, but increase your radius,</q> then which direction would you move?  What if someone said, <q>Hey you, keep your radius constant, but increase your angle</q>?
        </p>
      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          Now change the polar point to <m>(r,\theta) = (2,3\pi/4)</m>.  Try, without doing  any computations, to repeat part 2 (at the point draw both partial derivatives). Explain.
        </p>
      </task>
    </exploration>

    <p>
      If your answers to the 2nd and 3rd part above were the same, then you're doing this correctly. The partial derivatives, when vectors, tell us precisely about motion. The next exercise reinforces this concept.

    <p>
      In the previous exercise, you should have noticed that the partial derivatives of <m>\vec r(a,t)</m> are tangent vectors to the surface. Because we have two tangent vectors to the surface, we should be able to use them to construct a normal vector to the surface ( recall <xref ref="prob_crossproduct_normalvector"/> , and from that, a tangent plane (recall <xref ref="prob_plane_equation_normal_point"/>). That's just cool and leads us into the next section...

    <title>A Notational Diversion</title>
    <p>
      Since a partial derivative is a function, we can take partial derivatives of that function as well.
      If we want to first compute a partial with respect to <m>x</m>, and then with respect to <m>y</m>, we would write one of
      <me>
        f_{xy}=\ds\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      The shorthand notation <m>f_{xy}</m> is easiest to write. In upper-level courses, we will use subscripts to mean other things. At that point, we'll have to use the fractional partial notation to avoid confusion.
