  <introduction>

    <p>
      In the line integral chapter, we introduced the ideas of average value, centroid, and center of mass.
      We now extend those ideas to regions in the plane, in exactly the same way.
      For example, the average value formula in the line integral section was <m>\bar f = \dfrac{\int_C fdx}{\int_C ds}</m>.
      For double integrals, we just change <m>ds</m> to <m>dA</m>, and add an integral.
      This gives the formula <m>\bar f = \dfrac{\iint_R fdA}{\iint_R dA}.</m>

      <p> 
        Average value formula

    </aside>
    <p>
      The same substitution works on all the integrals from before.
      We now have <m>dm = \delta dA</m> instead of <m>dm=\delta ds</m>, as now density is a mass per area, instead of a mass per length.
      We obtained the arc length of a curve <m>C</m> by computing <m>s=\int_C ds</m>, as we just add up little bits of arc length.
      We can obtain the area of a region <m>R</m> by computing <m>A=\iint_R dA</m>, as we just add up little bits of area.

      The centroid of a region <m>R</m> in the plane is:

        \bar y = \frac{\iint_R y dA}{\iint_R dA}\right)

    <title>Optional: Applications to Inertia and Gyration</title>
    <p>
      One of the main reasons we are studying mass, center of mass, centroids, etc., is so that we can understand energy.
      The transfer of energy (for example from kinetic to electrical and then back from electrical to kinetic) is one of the most important ideas in modern innovations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of you may have already had a physics class, in which you learned that the kinetic energy of an object with mass <m>m</m> moving at speed <m>v</m> is
      <me>
        KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      If an object has a large mass, it takes a lot of work (transfer of energy) to get the object moving. Mass is an object's resistance to straight line motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      When something rotates, we need a handy way to compute its kinetic energy.
      We'll show that the kinetic energy of an object that is rotating about a line <m>L</m>, and has an angular velocity of <m>\omega</m> radians per second about the line, is precisely
      <me>
        KE = \frac{1}{2}I \omega^2,
      </me>
      where <m>I</m> is the (second) moment of inertia.
      If an object has a large inertia, it takes a lot of work (transfer of energy) to get the object rotating. Inertia is like an object's resistance to rotational motion.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        Compare the two formulas <m>KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</m> and <m>KE = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2</m>.  If we replace speed with angular speed, then we replace mass with inertia.  Heavy objects are hard to push. Objects with large inertia are hard to rotate.  Just as mass is an objects resistance to being moved, inertia is an objects resistance to being rotated.  Engineers build I-beams so that a large portion of the mass is far from the axis of rotation. This causes a large inertia, which prevents I-beams from rotating.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <definition>
      <title>Moment of Inertia</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can obtain the moment of inertia by integrating <m>I=\iint_R (d)^2 dm</m> where <m>d</m> is the radius of rotation about the axis <m>L</m> of rotation, which means that <m>d</m> is distance from a point <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the axis of rotation <m>L</m>. If the line <m>L</m> is one of the coordinate axes, then we obtain the key formulas
          <me>
            I_x = \iint_R (y^2)dm,
            I_y = \iint_R (x^2)dm,
            I_z = \iint_R (x^2+y^2)dm
            .
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      If you have never worked with kinetic energy before, you may skip the next exercise and then just practice using these formulas.

          Suppose that an object, whose mass is <m>m</m>, is attached to a string (whose mass is so small we'll ignore it). We rotate the object about a point, where the angular velocity is <m>\omega</m> radians per second. The length of the string (distance from the point to the center of rotation) is <m>d</m>.

      When we found average value, we wanted a height <m>\bar f</m> such that the area under <m>f</m> and the area under <m>\bar f</m> were the same. As an equation, we wrote
      <me>
        \iint_R \bar f dA = \iint_R f dA,
      </me>
      and then since <m>\bar f</m> is constant, we pulled it out of the integral, and then solved for <m>\bar f</m> to get
      <me>
        \bar f \iint_R dA = \iint_R f dA 
        \text{ or }

      This same process gives the center of mass. We could replace the variable distance <m>x</m> in <m>\int_C x dm</m> with the constant distance <m>\bar x</m>, and then solve for <m>\bar x</m> in the equation <m>\int_C \bar xdm = \int_C x dm</m>.
      If all the mass were located at one spot, what would that spot have to be for the first moments of mass to be the same. The radii of gyration are obtained in the exact same manner. We'll think of a radius of gyration as a rotational center of mass.
