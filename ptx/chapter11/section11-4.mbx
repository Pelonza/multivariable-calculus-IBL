  <title>Switching Coordinates: The Generalized Jacobian</title>
  <p>
    In this section you will learn how to...
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          switch coordinate systems for integration (<m>u</m>-substitution for higher dimensions)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    To find the Jacobian of the transformation <m>\vec T(u,v)=(x(u,v), y(u,v))</m>, we first find the derivative of <m>\vec T</m>. This is a square matrix, so it has a determinant, which should give us information about area. As the determinant may be positive or negative, we then take the absolute value to obtain the Jacobian. Formally:
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\vec T(u,v)=(x(u,v),y(u,v))</m> is a differentiable coordinate transformation. The Jacobian of the transformation <m>\vec T</m> is the absolute value of the determinant of the derivative. Notationally we write
        <me>
          J(u,v) = \frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)} = |\det(D\vec T(u,v))|.
        </me>
      </p>

  <p> 
    For a tongue twister, say <q>the absolute value of the determinant of the derivative</q> ten times really fast.

  <exploration>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the transformation <m>u=x+2y</m> and <m>v=2x-y</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <p>
        Solve for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in terms of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Next compute the Jacobian <m>\frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)}</m>.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        We were give <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in terms of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, so we could have directly computed <m>\frac{\partial (u,v)}{\partial (x,y)}</m>. Do so now.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Make a conjecture about the relationship between <m>\frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)}</m> and <m>\frac{\partial (u,v)}{\partial (x,y)}</m>.
      </p>
    </task>
  </exploration>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>f</m> is integrable over a region <m>R_{xy}</m> in the <m>xy</m> plane. Suppose that <m>\vec T(u,v)=(x(u,v),y(u,v))</m> is a coordinate transformation that has the Jacobian <m>\ds \frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)}</m>. Suppose the region <m>R_{uv}</m> in the <m>uv</m>-plane corresponds to the region <m>R_{xy}</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane. Provided the Jacobian is nonzero except possibly on regions with zero area, we can then write
        <me>
          \iint_{R_{xy}} f(x,y) dxdy = \iint_{R_{uv}} f(x(u,v),y(u,v)) \frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)} dudv.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        We can remember this in differential form as
        <me>
          dxdy = \frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)} dudv.
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Let's use this to rapidly find the area inside of an ellipse.
  </p>

  <exploration>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the region <m>R</m> inside the ellipse <m>\left(\dfrac{x}{a}\right)^2+\left(\dfrac{y}{b}\right)^2=1</m>. We'll consider the change of coordinates given by <m>u=(x/a)</m> and <m>v=(y/b)</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <p>
        Draw the region <m>R</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        After substituting <m>u=x/a</m> and <m>v=y/b</m>, draw the region <m>R_{uv}</m> in the <m>uv</m>-plane.  You should have a circle.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        What is the area inside this circle in the <m>uv</m>-plane?
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Solve for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and then compute the Jacobian  <m>\dfrac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)}</m>.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Show how to get the same result from directly computing <m>\dfrac{\partial (u,v)}{\partial (x,y)}</m>.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We know the area in the <m>xy</m>-plane of the ellipse is <m>\iint_{R_{xy}} dxdy</m>. Use the previous theorem to switch to an integral over the region <m>R_{uv}</m>.  Then evaluate this integral by using facts about area to prove that the area in the <m>xy</m> plane is <m>\pi a b</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          you don't actually have to set up any bounds, rather just reduce this to an area integral over the region <m>R_{uv}</m>.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </task>
  </exploration>

  <exploration>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be the region in the plane bounded by the curves:
        <md>
          <mrow>x+2y\amp =1</mrow>
          <mrow>x+2y\amp =4</mrow>
          <mrow>2x-y\amp =0</mrow>
          <mrow>2x-y\amp =8</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        We want to compute the integral <m>\iint_R xdxdy</m> using a change of coordinates. [Challenge: Try doing this without looking at the steps in the next paragraph]
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
      <p>
        Draw the region <m>R</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        Use the change of coordinates <m>u=x+2y</m> and <m>v=2x-y</m> to evaluate this integral.
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        What are the bounds for <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>?  You'll want to solve for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in terms of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>, and then you'll need a Jacobian.
      </p>
    </task>

        Make sure you provide a sketch of the region <m>R_{uv}</m> in the <m>uv</m>-plane (it should be a rectangle).
