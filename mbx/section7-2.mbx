  <title>The (multi-dimensional) Derivative</title>
  <p>
    In this section we will...
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          understand differentials in matrix notation
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          learn to compute partial and total derivatives
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Before we introduce multi-dimensional derivatives, let's recall the definition of a differential. If <m>y=f(x)</m> is a function, then we say the differential <m>dy</m> is the expression <m>dy=f'(x) dx</m>. We could also write this as <m>dy = \frac{dy}{dx}dx</m>. Similarly, if <m>w=g(t)</m> then we have the derivative as <m>\frac{dw}{dt}=g'(t)</m> and the differential as <m>dw=g'(t)dt</m>.
  </p>

  <observation>

  <p>
    Here's the key. Think of differential notation <m>dy=f'(x)dx</m> in the following way:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  A change in the output <m>y</m> equals the derivative multiplied by  a change in the input <m>x</m>. To get <m>dy</m>, we just need the derivative times <m>dx</m>.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    To get the derivative in all dimensions, we just substitute in vectors to obtain the differential notation <m>d\vec y = f'(\vec x) d\vec x</m>. The derivative is precisely the thing that tells us how to get <m>d\vec y</m> from <m>d\vec x</m>. We'll quickly see that <m>f'(\vec x)</m> must be a matrix, and then we'll start calling it <m>Df</m> instead of <m>f'</m>.
  </p>

    Let's now examine some exercises you have seen before.

    Part 4 in each exercise above is the KEY idea, let me repeat, THE KEY IDEA, to the rest of this course. It all goes back to differentials.

    <xref ref="unit6_content">Exercise</xref> is precisely the content to this chapter. We just need to add some vocabulary to make it easier to talk about what we just did. Let's introduce the vocabulary in terms of the exercise above, and then make a formal definition.

          <me>

          Some people call this the total derivative, as it's made up of two parts, called partial derivatives.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The first column of this matrix is just part of the whole derivative. We can get the first column by holding <m>y</m> constant, and then differentiating with respect to <m>x</m>. This is precisely a partial derivative.  We'll write this as <m>\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xy+3</m>, or sometimes just <m>f_x = 2xy+3</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The second column of the derivative is the partial of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>y</m>. We can get the second column by holding <m>x</m> constant, and then differentiating with respect to <m>y</m>. We'll write this as <m>\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x^2+20\cos(5y)</m>, or <m>f_y = x^2+20\cos(5y)</m>.

              The partial of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>y</m>, written <m>\ds \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}</m> or <m>f_y</m>, is the regular derivative of <m>f</m>, provided we hold every input variable constant except <m>y</m>. A similar definition holds for partial derivatives with respect to any variable.

            <p>
              The derivative of <m>f</m> is a matrix. The columns of the derivative are the partial derivatives. When there's more than one input variable, we'll use <m>Df</m> rather than <m>f'</m> to talk about derivatives.  The order of the columns must match the order you list the variables in the function. If the function is <m>f(x,y)</m>, then the derivative is 
               <m>Df(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\amp \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
              \end{bmatrix} .</m>

Add 8 vectors to your picture, and then write down to share with the class any observations you make.

    If your answers to the 2nd and 3rd part above were the same, then you're doing this correctly. The partial derivatives, when vectors, tell us precisely about motion. The next exercise reinforces this concept.

    In the previous exercise, you should have noticed that the partial derivatives of <m>\vec r(a,t)</m> are tangent vectors to the surface. Because we have two tangent vectors to the surface, we should be able to use them to construct a normal vector to the surface (<xref ref="prob_crossproduct_normalvector">recall</xref> , and from that, a tangent plane (<xref ref="prob_plane_equation_normal_point">recall</xref>. That's just cool and leads us into the next section...

    If you know that a plane passes through the point <m>(1,2,3)</m> and has normal vector <m>(4,5,6)</m>, then give an equation of the plane. See <fn>An equation of the plane is <m>4(x-1)+5(y-2)+6(y-3)=0</m>. If <m>(x,y,z)</m> is any point in the plane, then the vector <m>(x-1,y-2,z-3)</m> is a vector in the plane, and hence orthogonal to <m>(4,5,6)</m>. The dot product of these two vectors should be equal to zero, which is why the plane's equation is <m>(4,5,6)\cdot (x-1,y-2,z-3)=0</m>.</fn> for an answer.

      Consider again the parametric surface <m>\vec r(a,t) = (a\cos t, a\sin t, t)</m> for <m>2\leq a\leq 4</m> and <m>0\leq t\leq 4\pi</m>.
      We'd like to obtain an equation of the tangent plane to this surface at the point <m>\vec r(3,\pi)</m>. To find a plane we need a point and a normal (orthogonal) vector to the [tangent] plane.

      Since <m>\vec r_a (3,\pi)</m> and <m>\vec r_t (3, \pi)</m> (the two partial derivatives) are tangent to the surface they must be in our tangent plane also. So a vector orthogonal to <m>\vec r_a</m> and <m>\vec r_t</m> will be normal to the tangent plane.

    Since a partial derivative is a function, we can take partial derivatives of that function as well.
    If we want to first compute a partial with respect to <m>x</m>, and then with respect to <m>y</m>, we would write one of
    <me>
      f_{xy}=\ds\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x}.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    The shorthand notation <m>f_{xy}</m> is easiest to write. In upper-level courses, we will use subscripts to mean other things. At that point, we'll have to use the fractional partial notation to avoid confusion.
