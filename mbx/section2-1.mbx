    Learning to work with vectors will be key tool we need for our work in high dimensions. Let's start with some problems related to finding distance in 3D, drawing in 3D, and then we'll be ready to work with vectors.

  <exploration>
    <p>
      To find the distance between two points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m> in the plane, we create a triangle connecting the two points. The base of the triangle has length <m>\Delta x=(x_2-x_1)</m> and the vertical side has length <m>\Delta y=(y_2-y_1)</m>. The Pythagorean theorem gives us the distance between the two points as <m>\sqrt{\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2}=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}</m>.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Draw a 3-D axis then plot the points <m>(1,5)</m> and <m>(2,3)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Sketch the triangle that connects these two points and the origin <mdash /> <m>(0,0)</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Find <m>\Delta x</m> and <m>\Delta y</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Now extend your picture into 3 and use it to show that the distance between two points <m>(x_1,y_1,z_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2,z_2)</m> in 3-dimensions is <m>\sqrt{\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2+\Delta z^2}=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Use this formula to find the distance between the points <m>(1,5,2)</m> and <m>(2,3,3)</m>

      Recall that a circle (or sphere in 3-D) is just a collection of points which are all equal distance away from a center point.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the center of a circle is the point <m>(1,5)</m> what is the equation for a circle which passes through the point <m>(2,3)</m>?

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A vector is a magnitude in a certain direction.
        If <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are points, then the vector <m>\vec{PQ}</m> is the directed line segment from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>. This definition holds in 1D, 2D, 3D, and beyond.
        If <m>V=(v_1,v_2,v_3)</m> is a point in space, then to talk about the vector <m>\vec v</m> from the origin <m>O</m> to <m>V</m> we'll use any of the following notations:
        <me>
          \vec v = \vec{OV}=\left\lt v_1,v_2,v_3\right> 
          = v_1\mathbf{i}+v_2\mathbf{j}+v_3\mathbf{k} 
          = (v_1,v_2,v_3) 
          = \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\ v_2\\ v_3
          \end{pmatrix} 
          .
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        The entries of the vector are called the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> (or i, j, k) components of the vector.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Note that <m>(v_1,v_2,v_3)</m> could refer to either the point <m>V</m> or the vector <m>\vec v</m>. The context of the problem we are working on will help us know if we are dealing with a point or a vector.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\mathbb{R}</m> represent the set real numbers. Real numbers are actually 1D vectors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> represent the set of vectors <m>(x_1,x_2)</m> in the plane.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> represent the set of vectors <m>(x_1,x_2,x_3)</m> in space. There's no reason to stop at 3, so let <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> represent the set of vectors <m>(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)</m> in <m>n</m> dimensions.
      </p>
    </statement>

    In first semester calculus and before, most of our work dealt with problem in <m>\mathbb{R}</m> and <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>. Most of our work now will involve problems in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> and <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>. We've got to learn to visualize in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.

  <p>
    In a previous problem <xref ref="prob_donkey" /> you encountered <m>(x,y)=(3t,-t)</m>. This is an example of a function where the input is <m>t</m> and the output is a vector <m>(x,y)</m>. For each input <m>t</m>, you get a single vector output <m>(x,y)</m>. Such a function is called a parametrization of the donkey's path. Because the output is a vector, we call the function a vector-valued function. Often, we'll use the variable <m>\vec r</m> to represent the radial vector <m>(x,y)</m>, or <m>(x,y,z)</m> in 3D. So we could rewrite the position of the donkey as <m>\vec r(t)=(3,-1)t</m>. We use <m>\vec r</m> instead of <m>r</m> to remind us that the output is a vector.

      Suppose a horse races down a path given by the vector-valued function <m>\vec r(t) = (1,2)t+(3,4)</m>. (Remember this is the same as writing <m>(x,y) =  (1,2)t+(3,4)</m> or similarly <m>(x,y)=(1t+3,2t+4)</m>.)

        <li>
          <p>
            Draw the path followed by the horse.

        </li>
      </ol>

  </exploration>

  <p>
    In the last two problems we described the donkey and horse's paths using vectors. The use of vectors actually lets us do a lot more like give a generalized direction or easily compute their speed at any point along the path. To do that we need to define two more mathematical ideas, the magnitude and unit-vector.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The magnitude, or length, or norm of a vector <m>\vec v = \left\lt v_1,v_2,v_3\right></m> is <m>|\vec v| = \sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2}</m>. It is just the distance from the point <m>(v_1,v_2,v_3)</m> to the origin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that in 1D, the length of the vector <m>\left\lt -2\right></m> is simply <m>|-2|=\sqrt{(-2)^2}=2</m>, the distance to 0. Our use of the absolute value symbols is appropriate, as it generalizes the concept of absolute value (distance to zero) to all dimensions.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    In the special circumstance where a vector represents an object's velocity, the magnitude of the vector gives the objects <em>speed</em> or non-directional velocity.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A unit vector is a vector whose length is one unit. The notation for a unit vector is generally a <q><m>\hat{\ }</m></q> or <term>bold face</term>. Equivalently, the unit vector of a vector <m>\vec{v}</m> is: <m>\hat{v}=\frac{\vec{v}}{|\vec{v}|}</m>
      </p>

      <p>
        The standard unit vectors are <m>\mathbf{i}=\left\lt 1,0,0\right></m>, <m>\mathbf{j}=\left\lt 0,1,0\right></m>, <m>\mathbf{k}=\left\lt 0,0,1\right></m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
