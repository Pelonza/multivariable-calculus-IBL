  <p>
    We'll now see how the chain rule generalizes to all dimensions. Just as before, we'll find that the first semester calculus rule will generalize to all dimensions, if we replace <m>f'</m> with the matrix <m>Df</m>.
    Let's recall the chain rule from first-semester calculus.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <title>The Chain Rule</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>x</m> be a real number and <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be functions of a single real variable. Suppose <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>g(x)</m> and <m>g</m> is differentiable at <m>x</m>. The derivative of <m>f\circ g</m> at <m>x</m> is
        <me>
          (f\circ g)'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(f\circ g)(x) = f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x).
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Some people remember the theorem above as <q>the derivative of a composition is the derivative of the outside (evaluated at the inside) multiplied by the derivative of the inside.</q> If <m>u=g(x)</m>, we sometimes write <m>\ds \frac{df}{dx}=\frac{df}{du}\frac{du}{dx}</m>. The following exercise should help us master this notation.
  </p>

  <exploration xml:id="prob_chain_rule_review">
    <p>
      Suppose we know that <m>\ds f'(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{2x^2+3}</m> and <m>g(x)=\sqrt{x^2+1}</m>. Notice we don't know <m>f(x)</m>. EXTRA<fn> Not knowing a function <m>f</m> is actually quite common in real life. We can often measure how something changes (a derivative) without knowing the function itself.</fn>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            State <m>f'(x)</m> and <m>g'(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            State <m>f'(g(x))</m>, and explain the difference between <m>f'(x)</m> and <m>f'(g(x))</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Use the chain rule to compute <m>(f\circ g)'(x)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </exploration>

  <p>
    We now generalize to higher dimensions. If I want to write <m>\vec f(\vec g(\vec x))</m>, then <m>\vec x</m> must be a vector in the domain of <m>g</m>. After computing <m>\vec g(\vec x)</m>, we must get a vector that is in the domain of <m>f</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since the chain rule in first semester calculus states <m>(f(g(x))'=f'(g(x))g'(x)</m>, then in high dimension it should state <m>D(f(g(x)) = Df(g(x))Dg(x)</m>, the product of two matrices.

      In <xref ref="prob_differential_volume_of_a_cylinder">exercise</xref>, we showed that for a circular cylinder with volume <m>V=\pi r^2 h</m>, the derivative is

        DV(r,h)=\begin{bmatrix}2\pi rh \amp  \pi r^2

      Recall that to get this derivative we assumed that the radius and height are both changing with respect to time. Now we actually use functions for each letting <m>r=3t</m> and <m>h=t^2</m>. We'll write this parametrically as <m>\vec x (t) = (r,h)(t) = (3t, t^2)</m>.

            In first semester calculus, the chain rule was the product of derivatives. Multiply these matrices together to get find <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m>. I.E. computer:

    Let's look at some physical examples involving motion and temperature, and try to connect what we know should happen to what the chain rule states.

      Consider <m>f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2</m> and <m>\vec r(t)=(2\cos t, 3\sin t)</m>. Imagine the following scenario. A horse runs around outside in the cold.

    The previous three exercises all focused on exactly the same concept. The first looked at the concept graphically, showing what it means to write <m>(f\circ \vec r)(t)=f(\vec r(t))</m>. The second reduced the exercise to first-semester calculus. The third tackled the exercise by considering matrix derivatives. In all three cases, we wanted to understand the following exercise:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  If <m>z=f(x,y)</m> is a function of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, and both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are functions of <m>t</m> ( <m>\vec r(t)=(x(t),y(t))</m>), then how do we discover how quickly <m>f</m> changes as we change <m>t</m>. In other words, what is the derivative of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>t</m>. Notationally, we seek <m>\ds \frac{df}{dt}</m> which we formally write as <m>\ds \frac{d}{dt}[f(x(t),y(t))]</m> or <m>\ds \frac{d}{dt} [f(\vec r(t))].</m>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    To answer this exercise, we use the chain rule, which is just matrix multiplication.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="def_chain_rule">
    <title>The Chain Rule</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vec x</m> be a vector and <m>\vec f</m> and <m>\vec g</m> be functions so that the composition <m>\vec f(\vec g(\vec x))</m> makes sense (we can use the output of <m>g</m> as an input to <m>f</m>). Suppose <m>\vec f</m> is differentiable at <m>\vec g(\vec x)</m> and that <m>\vec g</m> is differentiable at <m>\vec x</m>. Then the derivative of <m>\vec f\circ \vec g</m> at <m>\vec x</m> is
        <me>
          D(\vec f\circ \vec g)(\vec x) = D\vec f(\vec g(\vec x))\cdot D\vec g(\vec x).
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        The derivative of a composition is equal to the derivative of the outside (evaluated at the inside), multiplied by the derivative of the inside.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    This is exactly the same as the chain rule in first-semester calculus. The only difference is that now we have vectors above every variable and function, and we replaced the one-by-one matrices <m>f'</m> and <m>g'</m> with potentially larger matrices <m>Df</m> and <m>Dg</m>. If we write everything in vector notation, the chain rule in all dimensions is the EXACT same as the chain rule in one dimension.

    You've now got the key ideas needed to use the chain rule in all dimensions. You'll find this shows up many places in upper-level math, physics, and engineering courses. The following exercise will show you how you can use the general chain rule to get an extremely quick way to perform implicit differentiation from first-semester calculus.

      To practice the idea developed in this exercise, show that if <m>w=F(x,y,z)</m> is held constant at <m>w=c</m> and we assume that <m>z=f(x,y)</m> depends on <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, then <m>\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = -\frac{F_x}{F_z}</m> and <m>\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -\frac{F_y}{F_z}</m>.

      </fn> Suppose <m>z=f(x,y)</m>. If <m>z</m> is held constant, this produces a level curve. As an example, if <m>f(x,y) = x^2+3xy-y^3</m> then <m>5=x^2+3xy-y^3</m> is a level curve. Our goal in this exercise is to find <m>dy/dx</m> in terms of partial derivatives of <m>f</m>.

      Suppose <m>x=x</m> and <m>y=y(x)</m>, so <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>. We can write this in parametric form as <m>\vec r(x) = (x,y(x))</m>. We now have <m>z=f(x,y)</m> and <m>\vec r(x)=(x,y(x))</m>.

You will get a chance to teach from this lesson plan prior to taking the exam. Then log on to Brainhoney and download the quiz. Once you have taken the quiz, you can upload your work back to brainhoney and then download the key to see how you did. If you still need to work on mastering some of the ideas, please do so and then demonstrate your mastery though the quiz corrections.}

    This concludes the \chaptername .  Look at the objectives at the beginning of the unit . Can you now do all the things you were promised? 

    \instructor{TeX files for these are included in a separate folder in the GitHub Project}
    \note{Those files should be cleaned up an generalized, i.e. remove specific instructor/course number from them. Possibly also make a master tex file to compile them all}

    <em>Review Guide Creation</em>


    Your assignment: organize what you've learned into a small collection of examples that illustrates the key concepts. I'll call this your unit<nbsp />review guide. I'll provide you with a template which includes the unit's key concepts from the objectives at the beginning. Once you finish your review guide, scan it into a PDF document (use any scanner on campus or photo software) and upload it to Gradescope. \instructor{Gradescope is a cool grading platform! \url{www.gradescope.com} } 


    As you create this review guide, consider the following:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Before each Celebration of Knowledge \instructor{This is just an exam} we will devote a class period to review. With well created lesson plans, you will have 4-8 pages(for 2-4 Chapters) to review for each, instead of 50-100 problems.
     \item Think ahead 2-5 years. If you make these lesson plans correctly, you'll be able to look back at your lesson plans for this semester. In about 20-25 pages, you can have the entire course summarized and easy for you to recall.
    \end{itemize}
