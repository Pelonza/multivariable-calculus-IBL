      Solve the following linear systems of equations.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\begin{cases}x+y\amp =3\\2x-y\amp =4
            \end{cases}</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\begin{cases}-x + 4y\amp =8\\3x - 12y\amp =2
            \end{cases}</m>

      Find all solutions to the linear system
      <m>\begin{cases}x+y+z\amp =3\\2x-y\amp =4
      \end{cases}</m>.
      Since there are more variables than equations, this suggests there is probably not just one solution, but perhaps infinitely many. One common way to deal with solving such a system is to let one variable equal <m>t</m>, and then solve for the other variables in terms of <m>t</m>. Do this three different ways.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you let <m>x=t</m>, what are <m>y</m> and <m>z</m>.  Write your solution in the form <m>(x,y,z)</m> where you replace <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> with what they are in terms of <m>t</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If you let <m>y=t</m>, what are <m>x</m> and <m>z</m> (in terms of <m>t</m>).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If you let <m>z=t</m>, what are <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
