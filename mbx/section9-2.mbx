    In first semester calculus, we learned that the area under a function <m>f(x)</m> above the <m>x</m>-axis is given by <m>A = \int_a^b f(x) dx</m>. The quantity <m>dA= f(x) dx</m> represents a small bit of area whose length is <m>dx</m> and whose height is <m>f(x)</m>. To get the total area, we just added up the little bits of area, which is why
    <me>
      A=\int dA = \int_a^b f(x) dx.

      <m>\vec r(t)=(2\cos t, 3\sin t)</m> for <m>t\in[0,2\pi]</m>. Think of this region as a metal plate that has been stood up with its base on <m>C</m> where the height above each spot is given by <m>z=f(x,y)</m>.

    Our results from the exercise above suggest the following definition.

  <definition>
    <title>Line Integral</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        EXTRA<fn>The line integral is also called the path integral, contour integral, or curve integral.</fn>
        Let <m>f</m> be a function and let <m>C</m> be a piecewise smooth curve whose parametrization is <m>\vec r(t)</m> for <m>t\in[a,b]</m>. We'll require that the composition <m>f(\vec r(t))</m> be continuous for all <m>t\in [a,b]</m>. Then we define the line integral
        of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> to be the integral
        <me>
          \int_C f ds 
          = \int_a^b f(\vec r(t))\frac{ds}{dt}dt
          = \int_a^b f(\vec r(t))\left|\frac{d\vec r}{dt}\right|dt.

    Notice that this definition suggests the following four steps. These four steps are the key to computing any line integral. EXTRA<fn>When we ask you to set up a line integral, it means that you should do steps 1<ndash />3, so that you get an integral with a single variable and with bounds that you could plug into a computer or complete by hand.</fn>

        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Multiply <m>f</m> by the speed, and replace each <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and/or <m>z</m> with what it equals in terms of <m>t</m>.

    Work, flow, circulation, and flux are all examples of line integrals. Remember that work, flow, and circulation are
    <me>
      W=\int_C (\vec F\cdot \vec T)ds =\int_C (M,N)\cdot(dx,dy) =  \int_C Mdx+Ndy,
    </me>
    while the formula for flux is
    <me>
      \Phi=\int_C (\vec F\cdot \vec n)ds =\int_C (M,N)\cdot(dy,-dx) =  \int_C Mdy+Ndx.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Do you see how these are both the line integral of a function <m>f = \vec F\cdot \vec T</m> or <m>f=\vec F\cdot \vec n</m> along a curve <m>C</m>. The function <m>f</m> inside the integrand does not have to represent the height of a sheet. We'll use it to represent lots of things. Let's practice two more work/flux exercises, to sharpen our skills with these concepts.
