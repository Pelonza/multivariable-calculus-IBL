  <title>Applications: Physical Properties</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A number of physical properties of real-world objects can be calculated using the concepts of averages and line integrals. We explore some of these in this section. Additionally, many of these concepts and calculations are used in statistics.

          Let <m>C</m> be a curve. If we look at all of the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the points on <m>C</m>, the <q>center</q> <m>x</m>-coordinate, <m>\bar x</m>, is the average of all these <m>x</m>-coordinates. Likewise, we can talk about the averages of all of the <m>y</m> coordinates or <m>z</m> coordinates of points on the function (<m>\bar y</m> or <m>\bar z</m>, respectively). The <term>centroid</term> of an object is the geometric center <m>(\bar x, \bar y, \bar z)</m>, the point with coordinates that are the average <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> coordinates.

    <title>Mass</title>
    <p>
      Density is generally a mass per unit volume. However, when talking about a curve or wire, as in this chapter, it's simpler to let density be the mass per unit length. Sometimes an object is made out of a composite material, and the density of the object is different at different places in the object. For example, we might have a straight wire where one end is steel and the other end is nickel. In the middle, the wire slowly transitions from being all steel to all nickel. The centroid is the midpoint of the wire. However, since nickel has a higher density than steel, the balance point (the center of mass) would not be at the midpoint of the wire, but would be closer to the denser and heavier nickel end. In this sub-section, we'll develop formulas for the mass and in the next sub-section formulas for the center of mass of such a wire. Such composite materials are engineered all the time (though probably not our example wire). \bmw{In future mechanical engineering courses, you would learn how to determine the density <m>\delta</m> (mass per unit length) at each point on such a composite wire.}\valpo{In future mechanical engineering courses, you may would learn how to determine the density <m>\delta</m> (mass per unit length) at each point on such a composite wire.}

    <title>Center of Mass</title>
    <p>
      EXTRA<fn><url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass">Wikipedia</url> has some interesting applications of center of mass.</fn>The center of mass of an object is the point where the object balances. In order to calculate the <m>x</m>-coordinate of the center of mass, we average the <m>x</m>-coordinates, but we weight each <m>x</m>-coordinate with its mass. Similarly, we can calculate the <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> coordinates of the center of mass.

      The next exercise helps us reason about the center of mass of a collection of objects. Calculating the center of mass of a collection of objects is important, for example, in astronomy when you want to calculate how two bodies orbit each other.

Many of you will have already seen an idea similar to this in statics, but in that class you are talking about moments of force, not moments of mass.

      EXTRA<fn>The quantity <m>\int_C x dm</m> is sometimes called the first moment of mass about the <m>yz</m>-plane (so <m>x=0</m>). Notationally, some people write <m>M_{yz} =\int_C x ds</m>. Similarly, we could write <m>M_{xz}=\int_C y dm</m> and <m>M_{xy}=\int_C zdm</m>.  With this notation, we could write the center of mass formulas as
      <me>
        (\bar x,\bar y,\bar z)

      We'll often use the notation <m>(\bar x, \bar y,\bar z)</m> to talk about both the centroid and the center of mass. If no density is given in a exercise, then <m>(\bar x, \bar y,\bar z)</m> is the centroid. If a density is provided, then <m>(\bar x, \bar y,\bar z)</m> refers to the center of mass.

      As you create this review guide, consider the following:
      \begin{itemize}
       \item Before each Celebration of Knowledge \instructor{This is just an exam} we will devote a class period to review. With well created lesson plans, you will have 4-8 pages(for 2-4 Chapters) to review for each, instead of 50-100 problems.
       \item Think ahead 2-5 years. If you make these lesson plans correctly, you'll be able to look back at your lesson plans for this semester. In about 20-25 pages, you can have the entire course summarized and easy for you to recall.
      \end{itemize}
      }
