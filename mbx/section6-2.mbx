        </fn>A horse runs around an elliptical track. Its position at time <m>t</m> is given by the function <m>\vec r(t)=(2\cos t, 3\sin t).</m> We could alternatively write this as <m>x=2\cos t, y=3\sin t</m>.

            Next to a few points on your graph, include the time <m>t</m> at which the horse is at this point on the graph. Include an arrow for the horse's direction.

            How many dimensions do you need to graph this function?

            If we wanted to plot time (t) on its own axis, how many dimensions would we need?

    Notice in the problem above that we placed a vector symbol above the function name, as in <m>\vec r\colon {\mathbb{R}}^n\to {\mathbb{R}}^m</m>. When the target space (codomain) is 2-dimensional or larger, we place a vector above the function name to remind us that the output is more than just a number.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the next problem, we keep the input as just a single number <m>t</m>, but the output is now a vector in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.

      A jet begins spiraling upwards to gain height. The position of the jet after <m>t</m> seconds is modeled by the equation
      <m>\vec r_2(t)=(2\cos t, 2\sin t, t).</m> We could alternatively write this as <m>x=2\cos t,\, y=2\sin t,\, z=t</m>.
