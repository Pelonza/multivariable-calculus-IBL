  <title>Parametric Equations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In middle school, you learned to write an equation of a line as <m>y=mx+b</m>. In the vector unit, we learned to write this in vector form as:
      <me>
        (x,y)=(1,m)t+(0,b)
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This style of equation is called a vector equation. It is equivalent to writing the two equations
      <me>
        x=1t+0,y=mt+b,
      </me>
      which we call the parametric equations of the line. We were able to quickly develop equations of lines in space, by just adding a third equation for <m>z</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parametric equations provide us with a way of specifying the location <m>(x,y,z)</m> of an object by giving an equation for each coordinate. We will use these equations to model motion in the plane and in space. In this section we'll focus mostly on planar curves.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If each of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are continuous functions, then the curve in the plane defined by <m>x=f(t),y=g(t)</m> is called a parametric curve, and the equations <m>x=f(t),y=g(t)</m> are called parametric equations for the curve.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      You can generalize this definition to 3D and beyond by just adding more variables.
    </p>

        By plotting points, construct graphs of the three parametric curves given below (just make a <m>t,x,y</m> table, and then plot the <m>(x,y)</m> coordinates). Place an arrow on your graph to show the direction of motion.

    <title>Derivatives and Tangent lines</title>
    <p>
      We're now ready to discuss calculus on parametric curves. The derivative of a vector valued function is defined using the same definition as first semester calculus.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\vec r(t)</m> is a vector equation of a curve (or in parametric form just <m>x=f(t), y=g(t)</m>), then the derivative is defined as:
          <me>
            \frac{d\vec r}{dt}=\ds\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\vec r(t+h)-\vec r(t)}{h}.
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>

      The subtraction above requires vector subtraction. The following problem will provide a simple way to take derivatives which we will use all semester long.

        [The definition above says that <m>\frac{d\vec r}{dt}=\ds\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\vec r(t+h)-\vec r(t)}{h}</m>. We were told <m>\vec r(t) = (f(t),g(t))</m>, so use this in the derivative definition. Then try to modify the equation to obtain <m>\frac{d\vec r}{dt} = (f'(t),g'(t))</m>.]

    <p>
      The previous problem shows you can take the derivative of a vector valued function by just differentiating each component separately. The next problem shows you that velocity and acceleration are still connected to the first and second derivatives.

          If an object moves along a path <m>\vec r(t)</m>, we can find the velocity and acceleration by just computing the first and second derivatives. The velocity is <m>\frac{d\vec r}{dt}</m>, and the acceleration is <m>\frac{d^2\vec r}{dt^2}</m>. Speed is a scalar, not a vector.
