    Suppose a heavy box needs to be lowered down a ramp.
    The box exerts a downward force of 200 Newtons, which we will write in vector notation as <m>\vec F=\left\lt 0,-200\right></m>.
    The ramp was placed so that the box needs to be moved right 6 m, and down 3 m, so we need to get from the origin <m>(0,0)</m> to the point <m>(6,-3)</m>. This displacement can be written as <m>\vec d=\left\lt 6,-3\right></m>. The force <m>F</m> acts straight down, which means the ramp takes some of the force. Our goal is to find out how much of the 200N the ramp takes, and how much force must be applied to prevent the box from sliding down the ramp (neglecting friction). We are going to break the force <m>\vec F</m> into two components, one component in the direction of <m>\vec d</m>, and another component orthogonal to <m>\vec d</m>.

      We want to write <m>\vec F</m> as the sum of two vectors: <m>\vec F = \vec w+\vec n</m>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            where <m>\vec w</m> is parallel to <m>\vec d</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            and <m>\vec n</m> is orthogonal to <m>\vec d</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>\vec w</m> is parallel to <m>\vec d</m>, we can write <m>\vec w=c\vec d</m> for some unknown scalar <m>c</m>.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Rewrite <m>\vec F</m> in terms of <m>\vec d</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Take the dot-product of both sides with <m>\vec d</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>\vec n</m> is orthogonal to <m>\vec d</m> we know that <m>\vec n \cdot \vec d =</m> ?
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Substitute and solve for the unknown <m>c</m>

    The solution to the previous problem gives us the definition of a projection.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The projection of <m>\vec F</m> onto <m>\vec d</m>, written <m>\proj_{\vec d}\vec F</m>, is defined as
        <me>
          \proj_{\vec d}\vec F = \left(\frac{\vec F\cdot \vec d}{\vec d\cdot \vec d}\right)\vec d.
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

      EXTRA<fn>
        \thomasee{See 12.3:1-8 (part d).} 
        \stewarts{See 12.3: 39-44}
        </fn>Let <m>\vec u=(-1,2)</m> and <m>\vec v=(3,4)</m>. Compute the <m>\proj_{\vec v}\vec u</m>. Draw <m>\vec u,</m> <m>\vec v</m>, and <m>\proj_{\vec v}\vec u</m> all on one set of axis. Then draw a line segment from the head of <m>\vec u</m> to the head of the projection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now let <m>\vec w=(-2,0)</m>. Compute <m>\proj_{\vec v}\vec w</m>. Draw <m>\vec u,</m> <m>\vec v</m>, and <m>\proj_{\vec v}\vec w</m>. Then draw a line segment from the head of <m>\vec w</m> to the head of the projection.
    </p>
  </exploration>

  <p>
    One application of projections pertains to the concept of work. Work is the transfer of energy. If a force <m>F</m> acts through a displacement <m>d</m>, then the most basic definition of work is <m>W=Fd</m>, the product of the force and the displacement. This basic definition has a few assumptions.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The force <m>F</m> must act in the same direction as the displacement.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The force <m>F</m> must be constant throughout the entire displacement.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The displacement must be in a straight line.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Before the semester ends, we will be able to remove all 3 of these assumptions. The next problem will show you how dot products help us remove the first assumption.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recall the set up to <xref ref="prob_force_intro">problem</xref>. We want to lower a box down a ramp (which we will assume is frictionless). Gravity exerts a force of <m>\vec F=\left\lt 0,-200\right></m> N. If we apply no other forces to this system, then gravity will do work on the box through a displacement of <m>\left\lt 6,-3\right></m> m. The work done by gravity will transfer the potential energy of the box into kinetic energy (remember that work is a transfer of energy). How much energy is transferred?

      Find the amount of work done by the force <m>\vec F=\left\lt 0,-200\right></m> through the displacement <m>\vec d=\left\lt 6,-3\right></m>. Find this by doing the following:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find the projection of <m>\vec F</m> onto <m>\vec d</m>. This tells you how much force acts in the direction of the displacement. Find the magnitude of this projection.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Since work equals <m>W=Fd</m>, multiply your answer above by <m>|\vec {d}|</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Now compute <m>\vec F\cdot \vec d</m>. You have just shown that <m>W=\vec F\cdot \vec d</m> when <m>\vec F</m> and <m>\vec d</m> are not in the same direction.

    \bmw{\section{Wrap Up}
    Once you have finished the problems in this \chaptername and feel comfortable with the ideas, create a short one page lesson plan that contains examples of the key ideas.  You will get a chance to teach from this lesson plan prior to taking the exam. Then log on to Brainhoney and download the quiz. Once you have taken the quiz, you can upload your work back to brainhoney and then download the key to see how you did. If you still need to work on mastering some of the ideas, please do so and then demonstrate your mastery though the quiz corrections.}

    This concludes the \chaptername .  Look at the objectives at the beginning of the unit . Can you now do all the things you were promised? 

    \instructor{TeX files for these are included in a separate folder in the GitHub Project}
    \note{Those files should be cleaned up an generalized, i.e. remove specific instructor/course number from them. Possibly also make a master tex file to compile them all}

    <em>Review Guide Creation</em>


    Your assignment: organize what you've learned into a small collection of examples that illustrates the key concepts. I'll call this your unit<nbsp />review guide. I'll provide you with a template which includes the unit's key concepts from the objectives at the beginning. Once you finish your review guide, scan it into a PDF document (use any scanner on campus or photo software) and upload it to Gradescope. \instructor{Gradescope is a cool grading platform! \url{www.gradescope.com} } 


    As you create this review guide, consider the following:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Before each Celebration of Knowledge \instructor{This is just an exam} we will devote a class period to review. With well created lesson plans, you will have 4-8 pages(for 2-4 Chapters) to review for each, instead of 50-100 problems.
     \item Think ahead 2-5 years. If you make these lesson plans correctly, you'll be able to look back at your lesson plans for this semester. In about 20-25 pages, you can have the entire course summarized and easy for you to recall.
    \end{itemize}
