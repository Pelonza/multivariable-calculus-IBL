      In this section we'll focus on functions of the form <m>f\colon \mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^1</m> and <m>f\colon \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^1</m>; we'll keep the output as a real number. In the next problem, you should notice that the input is a vector <m>(x,y)</m> and the output is a number <m>z</m>. There are two ways to graph functions of this type. The next two problems show you how.

        A computer chip has been disconnected from electricity and sitting in cold storage for quite some time. The chip is connected to power, and a few moments later the temperature (in Celsius) at various points <m>(x,y)</m> on the chip is measured. From these measurements, statistics is used to create a temperature function <m>T=z=f(x,y)</m> to model the temperature at any point on the chip. Suppose that this chip's temperature function is given by the equation <m>T=z=f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2</m>. Eventually we'll be creating a 3D model of this function in this problem, so you'll need to place all your graphs on the same <m>x,y,z</m> axes. However, to begin with you may find it easier to start with several 2-D plots.

          Let <m>y=0</m>, Substitute this value into the temperature function <m>T=z=f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2</m>. Plot the resulting function in the <m>xz</m>-plane.

      <li>
        <p>
          Now let <m>x=0</m>. Substitute this value into the temperature function and simplify. Plot the result. This plot should appear in the <m>yz</m> plane and be another parabola.

            If you drew the above curves in 2-D it is time to combine them. You should end up with 3 lines or a basic wire frame. To make a more complete wireframe we need to add more curves.

          A level curve of a function <m>z=f(x,y)</m> is a curve in the <m>xy</m>-plane found by setting the output <m>z</m> equal to a constant. Symbolically, a level curve of <m>f(x,y)</m> is the curve <m>c=f(x,y)</m> for some constant <m>c</m>. A 2D plot consisting of several level curves is called a contour plot of <m>z=f(x,y)</m>.

      Notice that when we graphed the previous two functions (of the form <m>z=f(x,y)</m>) we could either construct a 3D surface plot, or we could reduce the dimension by 1 and construct a 2D contour plot by letting the output <m>z</m> equal various constants.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next function is of the form <m>w=f(x,y,z)</m>, so it has 3 inputs and 1 output. We could write <m>f\colon \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^1</m>. We would need 4 dimensions to graph this function, but graphing in 4D is not an easy task. Instead, we'll reduce the dimension and create plots in 3D to describe the level surfaces of the function.

      Most of our examples of function of the form <m>w=f(x,y,z)</m> can be drawn by using our knowledge about conic sections. EXTRA<fn>\valpo{If you feel a little lost and skipped the review unit on conic sections, now would be a good time to go back and go through it.}</fn> We can graph ellipses and hyperbolas if there are only two variables. So the key idea is to set one of the variables equal to a constant and then graph the resulting curve. Repeat this with a few variables and a few constants, and you'll know what the surface is. Sometimes when you set a specific variable equal to a constant, you'll get an ellipse. If this occurs, try setting that variable equal to other constants, as ellipses are generally the easiest curves to draw.

        The computer will shrink the largest vector down in size so it does not overlap any of the others, and then reduce the size of all the vectors accordingly.
